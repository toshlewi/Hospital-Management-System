School health staff need decision support for responding to respiratory viral
outbreaks. Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) tools are an
inexpensive and fast resource. Our objectives were to engage school districts to
inform the development of a risk-based calculator tool, test the tool across
hypothetical cases, and elicit feedback among school health staff. We
administered an online survey for Kindergarten (K) - Grade 5 teachers, school
health professionals, and other school staff to gather data about respiratory
viral disease interventions and model parameters. A risk calculator tool was
developed in which users choose hypothetical scenarios to estimate infection
risk per individual and compare interventions. Three case studies (CS) were
explored: CS1 - Rhinovirus transmission in a general education classroom with
"poor" vs. "great" air quality, CS2 - Influenza A virus transmission in a music
classroom with vs. without a portable air purifier, CS3 - SARS-CoV-2
transmission in a special education classroom with vs. without open
doors/windows. The prototype tool was presented at a national school nursing
meeting, and attendees were surveyed on (dis)likes and anticipated tool uses.
For the initial survey of Arizona school personnel (n = 132), the top
respiratory viral outbreak strategies reported by teachers were hand (94 %) and
surface hygiene (85.1 %). For all case studies, infection risks were above
thresholds used in other contexts but were comparable to published student
respiratory illness incidence data. At the national meeting, school nurses (n =
12) identified potential uses including advocating for interventions to
administrators. This work reflects a unique application of community partnership
and QMRA to address school health decision support.

DNA methylation (DNAm), capturing biological gestational age (GA) and epigenetic
gestational age acceleration (EGAA), can be modified by environmental exposures.
The Asthma&Allergy array is a new DNAm array developed with content focused on
asthma and allergy loci. The association between content on the Asthma&Allergy
array and chronological GA and EGAA has not been evaluated alone or in the
context of perinatal exposures. We performed an epigenome wide association
study(EWAS) based on chronological GA at single CpG sites and regions. We
further constructed a multi-CpG site methylation model to predict chronological
GA in cord blood from 391 newborn children from a Detroit-based birth cohort.
Associations between perinatal environmental factors with GA, epigenetic
gestational age (EGA), and EGAA were assessed. We identified 2,435 CpG sites
associated with chronological GA. HLA class II ( HLA-DRB1,HLA-DQB1,HLA-DRB6 )
were the most significantly associated with chronological GA. Our multi-CpG site
model attained predictive accuracy (cross-validated Pearson's correlation=0.75)
comparable to other EGA methods. Using genes implicated in region-based analyses
(n=395 regions), the pathways most significantly enriched with chronological
GA-associated CpGs included T helper 1(Th1) and 2(Th2) activation, macrophage
classical activation, and IL10 signaling, which were also enriched in at least
one of the other published epigenetic clocks. In multi-exposure models, prenatal
indoor pet exposure and unplanned C-section were associated with EGA
deceleration, while infant's first-born status was associated with EGAA. Our
findings highlight enrichment for T cell modulated pathways and antigen
presentation as biological processes enriched in chronological GA, as well as
novel perinatal factors that may impact EGAA.

PURPOSE: Caregivers of hemodialysis patients are at high risk of developing
reduced quality of life (QoL) and increased caregiver burden.
AIM: This study aims to explore the level of caregiver burden and quality of
life in caregivers of hemodialysis patients in central India.
METHODS: This cross-sectional mixed-method study was undertaken among caregivers
of stable hemodialysis patients attending a tertiary care hospital in central
India. The Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) and WHOQoL BREF questionnaire measured
caregiver burden and QoL. The qualitative data was gathered through in-depth
interviews using a semi-structured open-ended questionnaire that delved into
their personal experiences with caregiving. The transcripts of these interviews
were analysed using applied thematic analysis, allowing for the identification
and exploration of recurring themes and patterns within the data.
RESULTS: A total of 105 caregivers took part in this study, with a mean age of
40.04 ± 12.96 years. 56 (53.3%) caregivers were female. Most (48.6%, n = 51)
were spouses/partners. Ten caregivers (9.5%) had to change their occupations due
to caregiving responsibilities. 14 (23.33%) had comorbidities (diabetes,
hypertension, asthma, and arthritis) themselves. The mean caregiver burden level
(ZBI) was 18.55 ± 7.58. Most (59.0%) experienced mild to moderate burden, while
28.6% reported a high burden. The WHOQoL BREF mean score of various domains of
physical health, psychological, social relationship and environmental was
35.70 ± 12.14, 44.20 ± 13.28, 44.28 ± 15.10 and 40.07 ± 13.36 respectively. The
thematic analysis revealed, difficulty in continuing education and employment,
changing jobs, the need to travel long distances to reach dialysis facilities
and hardship due to COVID-19 pandemic as recurring challenges among caregivers.
CONCLUSION: Caregivers of Hemodialysis patients had significant caregiver burden
and poor QoL. Regular assessment and special attention are needed for these
caregivers.

BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are critical assessment tools for
clinical practice, observational studies, and interventional trials. While
families of children with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) and
SJIA-associated lung disease (SJIA-LD) report significant limitations in their
quality of life, existing PROs for juvenile idiopathic arthritis may not
properly measure the full impact of these disorders. Our objective was to
utilize a newly developed lung symptom survey as well as existing, validated
Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures in
children with SJIA with and without LD.
METHODS: Participants were parents/guardians of SJIA patients ≤ 18 years and
were invited to participate using the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical
Center (CCHMC) JIA Registry, and memberships in the Systemic JIA Foundation, and
SJIA Facebook Group. Participants provided proxy-reports for their child using
several PRO questionnaires [CCHMC Lung Symptom Survey; PROMIS Asthma Impact,
Sleep Disturbance, Sleep Impairment Forms] and selected demographic and SJIA
specific information.
RESULTS: There were 139 responses, of which 40.3% (n = 57) reported some lung
disease including 12.9% (n = 20) with interstitial lung disease (ILD), pulmonary
alveolar proteinosis (PAP) and/or pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH). All SJIA
patients with any lung disease and those with ILD/PAP/PAH had significantly
higher total questionnaire scores than patients without lung disease on the
CCHMC Lung Symptoms Survey. Both the full survey and individual questions showed
good ability to distinguish patients with ILD/PAP/PAH from those without (area
under the curve (AUC) > 0.7). The majority of patients reported some level of
sleep disturbance (n = 71/139 = 51.1%) and sleep impairment 53.2% (n = 74)
regardless of presence or absence of lung disease, including moderate to severe
sleep impairment and/or disturbance in 48% of SJIA patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Children with SJIA and lung problems had higher scores on the CCHMC
Lung Symptom Survey; however, these measures did not discriminate between
SJIA-LD and other pulmonary conditions such as asthma. Based on PROMIS measures,
a majority of children with SJIA had sleep disturbance and impairment,
regardless of steroid use or presence of lung disease.

BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is common worldwide and of particular concern
for populations at higher latitudes, including those in developed areas such as
Australia. The role of vitamin D in modulating bone health and the immune system
is well recognized. Patients frequently have vitamin D deficiency identified and
managed in the primary healthcare setting. Despite the high prevalence of use in
Australia, allergies to supplemental vitamin D are uncommon.
CASE PRESENTATION: The case presented here is a 53-year-old Caucasian female of
Northern European ancestry, with a history of asthma and irritable bowel
syndrome who was prescribed supplemental vitamin D. She experienced dyspepsia
and stomach cramps within minutes of ingesting a vitamin D supplement. An
alternative formulation of vitamin D produced similar gastrointestinal effects,
worsening asthma and a rash. The results of the investigations were unremarkable
except for mildly elevated total immunoglobulin levels. The patient was referred
to an allergy clinic where a diagnosis of vitamin D hypersensitivity, with
features of both immunoglobulin-E-mediated (type 1) and T-cell (type 4)-mediated
pathways, was made. A desensitization program was commenced using a modified
Australian protocol. During the 18-week course, the patient was exposed to
increasing doses of vitamin D, and after 6 months, a daily dose of 1000 IU was
tolerated. She continues to use daily antihistamines and avoids foods rich in
vitamin D.
CONCLUSION: This case report highlights a rare likely allergic reaction to
supplemental vitamin D. The patient was never known to have supratherapeutic
levels of vitamin D, but her history of atopy may increase the likelihood of an
immune-mediated response to the supplement. While skin sensitivity testing was
negative, a provocation test and the Naranjo scoring system indicated that a
"probable" allergy occurred. Vitamin D deficiency is easily detected in primary
healthcare, and oral supplementation is usually a safe and effective means to
restore blood levels. While reactions to vitamin D supplementation in normal
doses are rare, an allergic cause should be considered when there are no other
likely precipitants. Personalized, carefully supervised, desensitization to
vitamin D may enable the resumption of supplementation and help prevent
unnecessary morbidity and mortality from vitamin D deficiency.

This study aimed to investigate the potential impact of neighborhood deprivation
on the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among individuals with
asthma. This nationwide, open cohort study conducted in Sweden from 1997 to 2018
included asthma patients of all ages (n = 1,051,240) to assess their subsequent
risk of developing T2DM. The study compared asthma patients residing in highly
deprived neighborhoods with those living in moderately or less deprived areas
(reference group). Cox proportional hazards regression models were employed to
analyze the association between neighborhood deprivation and T2DM incidence,
with results expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%
CIs). Analyses were stratified by sex and adjusted for potential confounders. A
significant association between neighborhood deprivation and T2DM risk in asthma
patients was shown. These associations remained statistically significant after
adjusting for confounders, with adjusted HRs of 1.44 (95% CI 1.38-1.50) for men
and 1.51 (95% CI 1.46-1.57) for women. Furthermore, a graded relationship was
observed, with higher levels of neighborhood deprivation associated with an
increased incidence of T2DM among asthma patients. These findings underscore
critical clinical and public health concerns. The results of this study provide
valuable insights for policymakers, highlighting the need to consider
neighborhood deprivation when allocating resources in primary healthcare
settings. They also offer guidance for optimizing clinical care strategies for
patients in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities.

The Human Phenotype Project (HPP) is a large-scale deep-phenotype prospective
cohort. To date, approximately 28,000 participants have enrolled, with more than
13,000 completing their initial visit. The project is aimed at identifying novel
molecular signatures with diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic value, and at
developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictive models for disease
onset and progression. The HPP includes longitudinal profiling encompassing
medical history, lifestyle and nutrition, anthropometrics, blood tests,
continuous glucose and sleep monitoring, imaging and multi-omics data, including
genetics, transcriptomics, microbiome (gut, vaginal and oral), metabolomics and
immune profiling. Analysis of these data highlights the variation of phenotypes
with age and ethnicity and unravels molecular signatures of disease by
comparison with matched healthy controls. Leveraging extensive dietary and
lifestyle data, we identify associations between lifestyle factors and health
outcomes. Finally, we present a multi-modal foundation AI model, trained using
self-supervised learning on diet and continuous-glucose-monitoring data, that
outperforms existing methods in predicting disease onset. This framework can be
extended to integrate other modalities and act as a personalized digital twin.
In summary, we present a deeply phenotyped cohort that serves as a platform for
advancing biomarker discovery, enabling the development of multi-modal AI models
and personalized medicine approaches.

Children with chronic diseases face a higher risk of mental health disorders.
However, the cognitive consequences of food allergies (FA), which are not
classified as a chronic disease, remain insufficiently researched. The objective
of this study is to examine the association between FA and mental health in
children and adolescents, compared to children and adolescents without FA
(controls) and those with other chronic conditions but no history of FA. This is
a retrospective cohort study using IQVIA Medical Research Data from UK primary
care practices. Five cohorts of children aged 0-18 between 2000 and 2021 were
defined: FA, control, asthma, atopic dermatitis (AD), and type 1 diabetes (T1D).
The study included 1,130,721 children without FA (control), 23,263 with FA,
136,453 with asthma, 207,575 with AD, and 4835 with T1D. Compared to control, FA
patients had higher risks of eating disorders (hazard ratio (HR) 1.85, 95% CI
1.42-2.41), anxiety (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.25-1.45), and depression (HR 1.24, 95% CI
1.11-1.39). FA patients had lower depression risk than asthma and T1D patients
(HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68-0.87, 0.64, 95% CI 0.54-0.76, respectively) and lower
anxiety risk than asthma patients (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79-0.91). FA patients' risk
of eating disorders was not significantly different from asthma and T1D patients
(HR 1.17, 95% CI 0.88-1.55, 1.58, 95% CI 0.81-3.10, respectively) but was
significantly higher than in the AD group (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.07-1.90).
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that children with FA face elevated risks of
anxiety, depression, and eating disorders compared to children without FA, and
that these risks vary when compared to children with other chronic conditions.
These findings highlight the need for integrated mental health support in FA
management and greater awareness of FA's psychological impact among healthcare

WHAT IS KNOWN: • Children with chronic illnesses such as asthma and diabetes are
known to have an elevated risk of mental health disorders. However, research on
the mental health impact of food allergies remains limited.
WHAT IS NEW: • This study reveals that children with FA have significantly
increased risks of anxiety, depression, and eating disorders compared to
children without FA and provides comparative insights into the mental health
risks of FA relative to other chronic conditions like asthma, atopic dermatitis,
type 1 diabetes, and healthy controls.

The National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS), which focuses on
non-communicable diseases (NCDs), their risk factors and healthcare demand, is a
cross-sectional, nationwide, population-based survey conducted every four-year
cycle since 2011. NHMS 2023 was the 7th cycle of NCDs, their risk factors and
healthcare demand, which aimed to monitor trends in diseases and healthcare
utilisation. This article outlines the methodology, sociodemographic
characteristics, and overall findings from the population surveyed in 2023
regarding NCDs, their risk factors, and various health-related topics. This
survey utilised a two-stage stratified random sampling design and encompassed
fifteen main scopes, with sample sizes calculated to meet the specific
requirements of each scope. Conducted from July to September 2023, it involved
the random selection of 499 enumeration blocks(EBs) by the Department of
Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) across all states and federal territories in
Malaysia. The step resulted in the selection of 5,988 living quarters (LQs).
Data collection methods included validated questionnaires administered through
face-to-face interviews and self-administered questionnaires, alongside clinical
assessments and blood investigations using calibrated devices. To ensure the
high quality of the collected data, we implemented stringent quality control
measures. Furthermore, we applied complex sampling analyses to ensure that the
findings accurately represented the population in Malaysia. The survey received
responses from 13,616 individuals out of the 5,006 LQs that were successfully
visited, resulting in an overall response rate of the survey of 83.2%, which
includes individuals aged 5 years and above. A substantial segment of the
population lived in urban regions, comprising 77.6% of the total. About half of
the population consisted of males (51.9%), Malay (54.6%), and individuals who
had attained secondary education (54.2%). Additionally, 20.0% of the population
were within the age range of 30 to 39 years. The weighted prevalence of diabetes
was 15.6%, hypertension 29.2%, hypercholesterolaemia 33.3%, overweight and
obesity 54.4%. Depression among adults was 4.6%, while mental health problems
among children were reported at 16.5%. The current tobacco smokers prevalence
was 19.0%, and 29.9% of adults in Malaysia were physically inactive. The known
asthma prevalence among adults was 6.2%, while the current asthma among children
was 3.4%. Additionally, 37.7% of adults experienced sleep insufficiency. The
results indicate that the higher proportion of diabetes, hypertension, and
hypercholesterolaemia, particularly among the young age group, and the high
prevalence of overweight and obesity, as well as mental health problems, are
making the healthcare system deal with more non-communicable diseases,
complications, and problems. The methodology of this survey is robust for a
population-based study. We took comprehensive steps to ensure the validity and
reliability of the findings. The findings indicate an urgent need for targeted
public health interventions to address the escalating health issues. By focusing
on prevention and early intervention strategies, we can mitigate the impact of
NCDs on the healthcare system and improve overall population health.

Medical devices that come in direct contact with human skin or the oral cavity
will inevitably be contaminated with microorganisms, including potential
pathogens. Ensuring the microbiological safety of such devices is therefore
crucial to prevent infections. Healthcare institutions usually have the
facilities needed for effective sterilization of reusable medical devices.
However, effective sterilization or disinfection of medical devices for usage at
home has remained challenging both in terms of pathogen elimination and user
safety. Preferably, this involves easy-to-operate equipment that works at
relatively low temperatures and atmospheric pressure. In principle this need can
be met by disinfection with steam. Therefore, the objective of the present study
was to examine the efficacy of a simple electronic steam machine designed for
home usage. Our results show that exposure to steam at 100 °C for 60 s resulted
in complete eradication (100% reduction) of bacterial contaminants, including
Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Significant bacterial
reductions (ranging from ~ 90-100%) were also observed within shorter exposure
times (10-30 s), depending on the strain. Importantly, the applied steam
disinfection approach is effective even against biofilm-embedded bacteria, or
bacteria applied to a medical device for home usage, as exemplified with a
nebulizer that is used by patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD). In conclusion, our results provide quantitative proof-of-concept
evidence that portable steam-generating devices that operate at atmospheric
pressure can be used for effective disinfection of reusable medical devices in
home settings.

INTRODUCTION: One in four cases of asthma in adults is caused or worsened by
work (work-related asthma: WRA). Early detection of WRA could prevent poor
health and employment outcomes, but clinical diagnosis is often missed or
delayed. The standardisation and effectiveness of screening tools have not been
well established. We aimed to summarise and compare the performance of screening
tools for identifying WRA in both clinical settings and workplaces.
METHODS: We searched for studies that used structured questionnaires or
prediction models (with/without physiological tests) to identify WRA in clinical
settings or workplaces with individuals aged≥16 years in MEDLINE, Embase, other
bibliographic databases and grey literature between 1975 and 2024. Two reviewers
independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts for inclusion, extracted
data and assessed risk of bias using QUADAS-2 tool (Quality Assessment of
Diagnostic Test Accuracy 2) or PROBAST (Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment
Tool). Screening tools and their indices of accuracy were summarised with paired
forest plots of sensitivities and specificities.
RESULTS: Of 17 504 identified studies, 7 were included. All were implemented in
tertiary hospitals (n=5) and specialist centres (n=2). The screening tools
comprised questionnaires alone (individual questions n=3 and multiple questions
n=2), questionnaire with methacholine challenge test (n=1) and diagnostic models
(n=4). The question 'improvement off work' had sensitivity=74-87% and
specificity=15-58% for identifying WRA. Multiple questions had
sensitivity=80-100% and specificity=8-55%. Addition of the methacholine
challenge test to one questionnaire improved specificity to 75% with
sensitivity=65%. Diagnostic models reported area under the curve (AUC) between
0.69 and 0.89, and AUC was improved when adding demographic variables or
objective tests.
DISCUSSION: A single item 'improvement off work' and multiple questions have
high sensitivity but low specificity for WRA, which are sufficient for screening
purposes to enhance WRA diagnosis. Adding demographic variables and objective
tests can improve specificity or AUC. However, studies on screening tools for
WRA are limited and inadequately reported; further evaluations of performance
are needed in primary care populations and workplaces.

BACKGROUND: The MANDALA study (NCT03769090) in moderate-to-severe asthma served
as the basis of the Food and Drug Administration's 2023 approval of
albuterol-budesonide 180/160 µg pressurized metered-dose inhaler for the
as-needed treatment or prevention of bronchoconstriction and to reduce
exacerbation risk in patients with asthma ≥18 years of age. Clinicians would
benefit from an understanding of the patterns of use of albuterol-budesonide
versus albuterol and overall inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) exposure when
ICS-containing rescue therapies are utilized alongside ICS-based maintenance
therapies.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patterns of as-needed use and safety profiles of
albuterol-budesonide 180/160 µg versus albuterol 180 µg, using data from
MANDALA.
METHODS: Study medication use was patient-documented via electronic diary.
Safety was assessed as adverse events (AEs). Patterns of study medication use (2
inhalations = 1 dose) were summarized as mean percentages of days where
inhalations/day fell within pre-defined categories (0, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10,
11-12, >12).
RESULTS: The safety population included 981 patients randomized to as-needed
albuterol-budesonide and 981 to as-needed albuterol. Patients adhered to
maintenance therapy regimens on a mean of ≥75% of days. Use of as-needed study
drug was similar in both groups (mean of 2.6 and 2.8 inhalations/day of
albuterol-budesonide and albuterol, respectively). High daily use (≥8
inhalations/day) or long-term high-daily use (≥7 consecutive days) was rare. AE
frequencies (ICS-associated and not) were low and comparable between groups,
regardless of mean daily as-needed use.
CONCLUSION: Patterns of use and safety profiles were similar between as-needed
albuterol-budesonide and albuterol.

Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channel serves as a critical
mediator of nociceptive signaling across neural circuits, modulating
pathophysiological processes from asthma to neurogenic inflammation through its
unique ability to integrate chemical, thermal, and mechanical stimuli. Real-time
monitoring conformational dynamics of TRPA1 is of significance for dissecting
the roles of TRPA1 channel. Here, we present a small molecular fluorescence
probe FPTRP-1 featuring a state-dependent fluorescence signature that directly
correlates with TRPA1 gating status. Confocal imaging verifies that the probe
FPTRP-1 has high selectivity for TRPA1 channel, and can monitor the on-off
states of TRPA1 in real time, providing a potential pharmacological tool to
further elucidate the physiological and pathological roles of TRPA1 channel in
biological systems.

School at Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA.
OBJECTIVE: Postictal psychosis (PIP) is one of the most common psychoses for
patients with epilepsy and is defined as psychotic symptoms presenting at least
1 week after a cluster of seizures. This case report illustrates an important
example of a clinical presentation of PIP.
METHODS: This case report identifies a 29-year-old Black man with a medical
history of asthma and epilepsy who presented with multiple seizures and
delirium. He has multiple hospital admissions and emergency department (ED)
visits over the past 1-2 years for recurrent seizure-like activity suggestive of
psychogenic nonepileptic seizures. On previous admissions for seizure-like
activity, he has been intubated because of uncooperativeness. On this admission
he presented to the ED after multiple at home seizures. In the ED, he became
increasingly delirious with no return to baseline mental status between
seizures. He was then intubated with bilateral wrist restraints for nonsensical
speech and agitation.
RESULTS: On day 4 in the intensive care unit, he returned to baseline mental
status. The patient was cooperative with medical treatment, alert, aware and
attentive, and no longer agitated. The patient was able to remember the previous
episode of seizure that led him to the ED. He was discharged on laxosamide 200
mg twice daily.
CONCLUSIONS: It is important to consider as a diagnosis in a patient with
epilepsy and changes in affect, mood, or the presence of delusions with no clear
lucid interval to ensure timely and effective treatment and limiting potential
future complications.

Herbal medicines have been proposed as adjuvant treatment for respiratory
diseases. One such agent is Plantago major (P. major). Therefore, this review
aims to gather the most recent experimental and clinical evidence on P. major's
therapeutic effects on respiratory diseases. This review search was performed
through Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus from the 1990s to
March 2024. In experimental studies, the effects of P. major on inflammation,
infection, asthma, and COPD models were established. In clinical studies, a
significant reduction in cough and wheezing, increases in FEV1 and FVC in
asthmatic patients, a rapid effect on signs and symptoms of bronchitis, and
antiviral effects were observed. Despite in vitro and animal studies, there are
limited clinical studies on the respiratory effects of P. major on humans.
Therefore, designing more clinical studies to identify the respiratory effects
of the plant and its derivatives should be considered.

BACKGROUND: Chronic urticaria is a common skin condition characterized by itchy
wheals (hives), angioedema, or both, lasting for 6 weeks or more. Beyond
antihistamines, multiple systemic treatments are available, but there is
uncertainty regarding their comparative effects on chronic urticaria outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: We systematically synthesized the comparative benefits and harms of
systemic treatments for chronic urticaria.
METHODS: As part of updating the AAAAI/ACAAI JTFPP chronic urticaria guidelines,
we searched Medline, Embase, Central, Chinese Biomedical Databases (CBM), China
National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Scientific Journal Database
(VIP), and Wanfang from inception to February 4, 2025, for randomized trials
addressing systemic immunomodulatory treatments, including phototherapy, for
chronic urticaria. Paired reviewers screened records, extracted data, and
assessed risk of bias. Random effects Bayesian network meta-analyses addressed
urticaria activity (comprising itch and wheal scores), angioedema activity,
health-related quality of life, and adverse events. The GRADE approach informed
certainty-of-evidence ratings (PROSPERO: CRD42023429819).
RESULTS: We included 93 studies (n = 11,398; mostly adult and adolescent
participants across 83 randomized trials and 10 nonrandomized studies) that
evaluated 42 interventions. With high certainty, standard-dose omalizumab (300
mg every 4 weeks) and remibrutinib are among the most effective for improving
multiple patient-important outcomes. The safety profile of remibrutinib,
however, is less certain. Dupilumab improved urticaria activity, but its impact
on quality of life is uncertain, and no dupilumab trials addressed angioedema
activity. Cyclosporine may be among the most effective for improving urticaria
activity but may be among the most harmful in increasing the frequency of any
adverse events. Azathioprine, dapsone, hydroxychloroquine, mycophenolate,
sulfasalazine, and vitamin D may improve outcomes, while benralizumab,
quilizumab, and tezepelumab may not differ from placebo, though the evidence is
uncertain. Findings were consistent across age groups and baseline severity, and
were robust to subgroup analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals with chronic urticaria refractory to
antihistamines, standard-dose omalizumab and remibrutinib are among the most
effective drugs across multiple patient-important outcomes with a favorable
safety profile across the studied duration. Cyclosporine may be effective but
may be among the most harmful. Dupilumab improves itch and wheals, but it is
uncertain whether it improves angioedema or quality of life. Lower doses of
omalizumab are of intermediate effectiveness and favorable safety. The net
benefit of conventional immunosuppressants is uncertain.

Comparative Efficacy of Two Inhalational Techniques when Using a Pressurized
Meter Dose Inhaler with Valved Holding Chamber in Children with Asthma: A
Randomized Controlled Trial.

India.
Introduction: Inhaled medication delivered through a pressurized metered dose
inhaler (pMDI) with a valved holding chamber (VHC) is the optimal treatment for
asthma. The best technique is the breath-holding (BH) technique. Tidal breathing
(TB) technique is also recommended by Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) as an
alternative. Clinical studies have shown variable results, but the scintigraphy
study shows better lung deposition with the BH technique. The present study was
designed to address the shortcomings in previous studies and to confirm the
scintigraphy study findings by comparing the two techniques. Methods: This
randomized controlled trial included children aged 5-14 years with nonsevere
asthma not taking inhaled medications on entry to the study, but during the
study, they were given inhaled medications by pMDI + VHC (according to GINA
guidelines) over an 8-week period. Demography, clinical details, spirometry
parameters, and asthma control were recorded/assessed. The primary outcome was
change in spirometry parameters at 2 and 8 weeks. Results: Eighty-two children
(mean age: 8.64 years, 46 boys) were included. There was no intergroup
difference in the spirometry parameters and asthma control scores at any point
in time (p > 0.05). A significant intragroup improvement was noted only for
forced expiratory volume in the first second at 8 weeks (p < 0.05). Similarly, a
significant intragroup improvement in asthma control score was noted at 8 weeks
(p < 0.05). No adverse event was noted in either of the groups. Conclusions: The
present study found no difference between the BH and the TB techniques while
delivering aerosols through a pMDI with a VHC. Either the BH or the TB technique
may be used in children (5-14 years) with nonsevere asthma. Clinical trial
registration number: CTRI/2020/12/030078.

Yamunanagar, 135001, Haryana, India.
BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris is a prevailing inflammatory condition of the skin
affecting areas with dense sebaceous glands, like the upper back, chest, face,
and arms. It impacts approximately 85% of Americans aged 12 to 25, which can
persist into adulthood. The condition is identified with pustules, comedones,
papules, and nodules, comprising psychological and social effects comparable to
chronic diseases like asthma.
OBJECTIVES: This study explores the potential of herbal treatments as
alternatives to conventional allopathic therapies for acne vulgaris, aiming to
address underlying causes with fewer side effects.
METHODOLOGY: A comprehensive literature review was conducted, examining clinical
studies, traditional medicinal sources, and recent research on various herbs,
including Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree), Curcuma longa (turmeric),
Azadirachta indica (neem), Aloe barbadensis (aloe vera), Camellia sinensis
(green tea), Salvia rosmarinus (rosemary), and AmaranthushypochondriacusLinn(
amaranths). Both topical and internal applications were considered, with a focus
on topical treatments for ease of use. The databases PubMed, Web of Science,
Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, and ScienceDirect were the main
sources of the data and content included in this review article. This helped to
preserve transparency and increased the credibility of this review article.
RESULTS: Herbal medicines are gaining traction due to their minimal adverse
effects and holistic approach. This study highlights promising results from
several herbs in reducing acne symptoms and improving skin health, emphasizing
the need for further clinical trials to substantiate these findings.
CONCLUSION: Herbal therapies offer a viable alternative for managing acne
vulgaris, potentially providing a holistic solution beyond symptomatic relief.
Continued research is important to understand their effectiveness and mechanisms
of action fully.

BACKGROUND: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting multiple organ
systems, including the central nervous system (CNS). Recent studies suggest an
association between asthma and neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Sensory processing disorder (SPD), a neurodevelopmental condition characterized
by atypical responses to sensory stimuli, may also be linked to asthma through
shared inflammatory mechanisms.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of SPD in children
with asthma as compared to those without asthma and explore its relationship
with asthma severity.
METHODS: This prospective, cross-sectional study included 182 children aged 5-12
years, with 91 asthmatic children in the study group and 91 nonasthmatic
children in the control group. Sensory processing abilities were assessed using
the Sensory Processing Measure (SPM) Home-Form. Statistical analyses, including
logistic regression and path analysis, were performed to evaluate the
association between asthma and sensory processing abnormalities.
RESULTS: Atypical sensory processing was significantly more prevalent in
asthmatic children compared to the control group across multiple sensory
domains, including vision, auditory, tactile, body awareness, balance, and
movement (p < 0.005). Logistic regression analysis revealed that asthma was
associated with increased risk of atypical sensory processing, particularly in
tactile (OR: 5.716, 95% CI: 2.9-11.3 p < 0.001) and balance/movement (OR: 8.8,
95% CI: 2.5-30.7, p = 0.001) domains. However, no significant association was
found between asthma severity and SPD prevalence.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that children with asthma exhibit a higher
prevalence of SPD, supporting the hypothesis that neuroinflammation may
contribute to sensory processing abnormalities. These results highlight the need
for multidisciplinary approaches in managing asthmatic children, considering
both respiratory and neurodevelopmental aspects. Further research is warranted
to explore underlying mechanisms and potential interventions.

Dupilumab, the first biologic approved for eosinophilic esophagitis treatment
(EoE-tx) in 2022, demonstrated favorable safety in phase-III clinical trials.
However, real-world dupilumab-associated adverse reactions (DARs) for EoE-tx are
unknown. This study aims to evaluate DAR for EoE-tx using the FDA Adverse Event
Reporting System. FDA Adverse Event Reporting System was queried for DAR between
2022Q1 and 2023Q4. Individual DARs (iDARs) were categorized and compared between
treatment groups: EoE, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis
with nasal polyps. Logistic regression was used to predict serious DAR and
outcomes, and zero-truncated negative binomial regression was used to predict
the number of iDAR. There were 51,000 DAR observations; 1459 for EoE-tx with 103
(7.1%) serious reactions and 44 (3.0%) serious outcomes including 3 deaths. For
EoE-tx, the mean iDAR was 3.68 [3.51, 3.85], and the iDAR incidence rate ratio
among men receiving EoE-tx was 0.73 [0.65, 0.83]. EoE-tx average iDAR primarily
included general (0.75 [0.70, 0.80]), injection-site (0.69 [0.63, 0.74]),
dermatologic (0.51 [0.46, 0.55]), and gastrointestinal (0.24 [0.21, 0.27])
reactions. Adults ≥50 years had 1.97 [1.28, 2.99] higher odds for serious DAR
compared to younger adults in EoE-tx. Overall, dupilumab demonstrated a
favorable safety profile across all indications, with low rates of serious
adverse events. For EoE-tx specifically, higher total iDAR rates were observed,
driven largely by increased injection-site and gastrointestinal reactions
compared to other indications. Additionally, women exhibited higher iDAR rates
than men across all indications.

BACKGROUND: Asthma and atopic dermatitis are common type-2 (T2)-driven diseases
that often coexist, although different T2 biomarkers indicate disease severity
in each condition. Multiple biologics target T2 inflammation, but only dupilumab
has been approved for both diseases. Little is known about patients with severe
asthma and comorbid atopic dermatitis, particularly regarding how this
comorbidity influences the choice of biologic for severe asthma.
METHODS: We utilised the nationwide Danish Severe Asthma Register to
characterise patients with severe asthma and comorbid atopic dermatitis, and
describe prescription patterns of biologics in patients with and without
comorbid atopic dermatitis. We compared biomarker determinants of first-line
dupilumab prescription between the two groups using a multivariate logistic
regression model adjusting for age and sex.
RESULTS: We identified 1137 patients initiating a biologic for severe asthma, of
whom 192 (17%) had comorbid atopic dermatitis. Patients with comorbid atopic
dermatitis more often had childhood-onset asthma with an allergic phenotype. The
prescription patterns of biologics differed according to comorbid atopic
dermatitis status, and patients with comorbid atopic dermatitis were more likely
to switch (OR 3.02, p < 0.001). In patients with comorbid atopic dermatitis,
elevated IgE was the strongest biomarker determinant of first-line dupilumab
prescription (OR 8.77, p < 0.001), whereas in patients without, it was elevated
FeNO (OR 1.76, p = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: Biologic prescription patterns in severe asthma vary according to
comorbid atopic dermatitis status. In patients with comorbid atopic dermatitis,
elevated IgE predicts first-line dupilumab prescription, indicating that the
severity of atopic dermatitis influences treatment decisions. Additional
research is needed to explore the management of coexisting T2 diseases with
biological therapies.

The Upper and Lower Airways Northern European Consensus (ULANC) and the European
Forum for Research and Education in Allergy and Airways diseases (EUFOREA)
organized their first workshop in Copenhagen in January 2024. The aim of the
"Primary care physicians and nurses with an interest in Global Airway Diseases
2024" was to bring the concept of the global airway to the front line of medical
care. ULANC is a multidisciplinary European consortium, that aims to improve the
management of comorbid ear, nose and throat (ENT) conditions, such as chronic
rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), in patients also suffering from
asthma. EUFOREA is an international non-profit organization forming an alliance
of all stakeholders dedicated to reducing the prevalence and burden of chronic
respiratory diseases through the implementation of optimal patient care via
educational, research, and advocacy activities. The inclusive and
multidisciplinary approach of ULANC and EUFOREA was reflected in the keynote
lectures and workshop faculty coming from the allergology, pulmonology, ENT, and
primary health care fields around the central theme of global airway diseases.
The current report aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the key
statements by the faculty of the "Primary care physicians and nurses with
interest in Global Airway Diseases 2024", allowing all stakeholders in the
respiratory field to be up-dated and ready to join forces in Europe and beyond.

Bronchial asthma (BA) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are chronic disorders of
the respiratory system; both diseases are widespread and can cause a decrease in
the quality of life. The latter contrasts the airway inflammation and excessive
reactivity that define BA, and the intermittent airway obstruction during sleep
that defines OSA results in periods of hypoxemia and disruptive breathing. BA
appears when children have OSA in addition to other disorders, including night
ventilation, breathlessness, and sleep conflicts. Current studies have focused
on inflammatory indicators such as the FeNO and CRP in these diseases. FeNO is a
measure of eosinophilic airway inflammation, which is usually high in asthma.
In, contrast, CRP is a measure of systemic inflammation that is usually high in
both forms of asthma. This review paper will focus on FeNO and CRP in connection
to the pathophysiology of BA and OSA with further descriptions of how these
markers relate to inflammation in both disorders. The review also focuses on how
these markers interlink in patients with both diseases and how FeNO and CRP can
also reflect the severity of the disease and the effectiveness of the treatments
being used. Finally, identifying the interaction between these markers might
advance the identification and management of patients with both BA and OSA.

BACKGROUND: Asthma is a heterogeneous group of diseases. The mechanism by which
dysregulated circRNAs affect severe asthma by regulating macrophage polarization
remains unclear.
METHODS: High-throughput RNA sequencing technology was used to analyze circRNA
expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with
severe asthma. RT-qPCR and ELISA were used to analyze the expression of
inflammatory factors in a mouse model of severe asthma induced by
ovalbumin-lipopolysaccharide. The effect of circ-0001875 on macrophage
activation and the underlying mechanism were analyzed by RT-qPCR, Western blot,
and ELISA. Subsequently, the regulatory relationships among circ-0001875,
miR-31-5p, and SP1 were examined through dual luciferase reporter gene assay,
and the mechanism by which they regulate macrophage polarization was analyzed by
Western blot.
RESULTS: Compared with the healthy control group, 420 circRNAs were
differentially expressed in PBMCs from patients with severe asthma. Among them,
circ-0001875, which was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm of monocytes, was
significantly downregulated in asthmatics, especially those with severe disease.
circ-0001875 overexpression inhibited M1 macrophage activation in vitro and
alleviated lung inflammation in a mouse model of severe asthma. Mechanistically,
circ-0001875 promoted SP1 translation by competitively binding to miR-31-5p,
thereby reducing its inhibitory effect on SP1 translation; SP1 then inhibited M1
macrophage polarization, which is associated with severe asthma, through the
NF-κB signaling pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that circ-0001875 plays an important role in regulating M1
macrophage polarization, which is associated with a severe pro-inflammatory
response.

BACKGROUND: Chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU) is characterized by wheals
and/or angioedema (AE) for 6 weeks or more in response to specific and definite
triggers. Individual patients can have more than one type of CIndU. Reports on
this come from single cases or small case series, most epidemiological studies
did not assess whether these urticaria are standalone or mixed.
OBJECTIVE: Determine the features of mixed CIndU and how they differ from
standalone forms.
METHODS: In a prospective cohort study we performed provocative testing in 210
patients with CIndU. A total of 188 patients were included (125 with the
standalone CIndU and 63 with the mixed CIndU. Within each group, patients were
divided into subgroups: symptomatic dermographism (SD), cold (ColdU) and
cholinergic urticaria (CholU).
RESULTS: Mixed CIndU most commonly were SD+ColdU (n=19, 30.2%), SD+CholU (n=15,
23.8%), SD+DPU (n=12, 19%) and ColdU+CholU (n=9, 14.3%). Comorbid chronic
spontaneous urticaria (CSU) (50.8% vs 20.8, p<0.001) and AE (36.5% vs. 20%,
p=0.014) were more common in patients with mixed CIndUs. In patients with mixed
CIndUs, their onset time is more closely linked to each other (n=43; 68.2%) as
compared to that of comorbid CSU (12 of 32, 37.5%). MixedSD patients are
younger, show earlier onset of disease and have higher rates of AE and lower
rates of atopic dermatitis (AtD), as compared to patients with standalone SD.
MixedColdU patients have higher rates of comorbid CSU and lower rates of AtD,
higher levels of total IgE and eosinophils. MixedCholU patients are older, have
a high rate of comorbid CSU, a lower incidence of allergic disease.
CONCLUSION: This study shows for the first time that each combinations of mixed
CIndU represent a distinct phenotype with its own features. These phenotypes
require special attention of specialists.

Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia is a rare idiopathic disease characterized by
eosinophilic infiltrates in the alveoli and interstitial lung spaces. There are
no specific diagnostic tests for this condition, but it is suspected in patients
presenting with dyspnea, cough, a tomographic pattern of consolidations,
peripheral ground-glass opacities, and peripheral eosinophilia. This report
presents the case of a male patient with chronic eosinophilic pneumonia that was
unresponsive to corticosteroid treatment.

Asthma diagnosis can be confirmed by observing significant bronchodilator
response (BDR) through peak expiratory flow (PEF) at home or forced expiratory
volume in 1 s (FEV1) via spirometry in a clinical setting. We aimed to use the
administration of salbutamol after a methacholine challenge test as a model of
bronchodilation to study how accurately the change in PEF predicts improvement
in lung function, as defined by an increase in FEV1. We analyzed 869 adult
patients who were administered salbutamol after a methacholine challenge. To
compare relative changes in PEF and FEV1 during bronchodilation, we used
regression analysis and constructed a Bland and Altman plot. ROC analysis,
sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and kappa
coefficient assessed how precisely increases in PEF detected a 12% and 0.2-L
improvement in FEV1. The average relative increase in FEV1 was significantly
greater than that in PEF. The area under the curve in the ROC analysis was 0.844
for PEF change to detect a 12% and 0.2-L increase in FEV1. The kappa values for
changes in PEF and FEV1 ranged from fair to moderate. BDR detected by the
recommended 15% and 60 L/min cut-off for PEF identified less than half of true
positives, while a 10% cut-off correctly identified close to 75% of them. PEF
increase is not a reliable measure of BDR in comparison to FEV1 increase, and a
10% improvement in PEF was the least inaccurate cut-off. Substituting the PEF
meter with a handheld spirometer should be further investigated for asthma home
monitoring.

Fe2O3 nanoparticles have been developed as carriers to transport drugs through
airway mucus (AM); however, their impacts on the rheological properties of AM,
especially in disease states, are unknown. In this study, we investigated the
abilities of Fe2O3 nanoparticles dispersed in various media to alter the
microstructure and rheological behaviors of simulated asthmatic AM. Here, the
simulated AM was prepared via reconstituted mucins and other components in a
composition resembling that of human AM reported in asthma, followed by
treatment with Fe2O3 nanoparticles before and after curing. Subsequently, the AM
samples treated with and without Fe2O3 nanoparticles were examined for their
microstructures by optical immunofluorescence microscopy and for the rheological
behaviors via steady-state and dynamic rotational rheometry. The results
indicate that the Fe2O3 nanoparticles disrupt the mucus microstructure by
inducing protein aggregation to increase the pore size and fiber diameter of the
AM. However, the Fe2O3 nanoparticles significantly reduced the magnitudes of the
viscoelastic properties of AM, including apparent viscosity, yield stress, and
dynamic viscoelastic modulus. Although the addition of Fe2O3 nanoparticles
before and after curing of AM appeared to produce similar effects, these effects
had greater magnitudes when the nanoparticles were added before curing. The
effects were also dependent on the concentration and surface property determined
by the dispersion medium of the nanoparticles; accordingly, Fe2O3 nanoparticles
dispersed at a concentration of 0.4 mg/mL in H2O were the most potent at
altering the microstructure and rheology of AM, producing better results than
the concentration of 0.4 mg/mL of the conventional mucolytic chymotrypsin.
Furthermore, tests on mucus samples collected from asthmatic patients showed
similar results to those obtained with the simulated AM. Together, these
findings suggest that Fe2O3 nanoparticles per se are useful as not only drug
carriers but also expectorant agents for AM clearance therapy; they may also be
more beneficial than pharmaceutical mucolytics owing to their wide availability
and high biocompatibility.

BACKGROUND: Previous research has indicated a possible association between
asthma and ankylosing spondylitis (AS).
METHODS: We pinpointed single nucleotide polymorphisms linked to various forms
of asthma and AS, employing them as instrumental variables for a bidirectional
two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) analysis. Our TSMR analysis focused on
European populations to minimize racial confounding. Multivariate adjustments
for body mass index (BMI), smoking, and alcohol use were performed to control
for confounders. Colocalization analysis was used to validate MR findings and
explore genetic links between asthma and AS.
RESULTS: Individuals with asthma and eosinophilic asthma exhibited a relatively
higher risk of AS (asthma: OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.07-1.62, P = 0.008; eosinophilic
asthma: OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.005-1.544, P = 0.044). Allergic asthma,
childhood-onset asthma, and obesity-related asthma showed no causal relationship
with AS (allergic asthma: IVW P = 0.27; childhood-onset asthma: IVW P = 0.66;
obesity-related asthma: IVW P = 0.53). After adjusting for cigarette smoking,
alcohol consumption, and BMI, the results supported a direct causal effect of
asthma on the increased risk of AS onset (IVW P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that a positive causal connection between
asthma, specifically eosinophilic asthma, and AS.

AIM: Sarcopenia causes death in the general population, but its relationship
with asthma-specific populations remains unknown. This study aimed to
investigate the relationship between sarcopenia and mortality risk, as well as
lung function in asthmatic population.
METHODS: All participants in this study were drawn from the China Health and
Retirement Longitudinal Study, which primarily involved longitudinal data for
the period 2011-2018. All participants were asthmatic and divided into
sarcopenia and non-sarcopenia groups. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to
calculate the cumulative mortality rate in each group. Cox proportional hazards
and linear mixed models were used to assess the effect of sarcopenia on
mortality risk and peak expiratory flow in an asthmatic population.
RESULTS: A total of 606 participants were included in the baseline analysis, of
which 32.5% had sarcopenia. During the 7-year follow-up period, the cumulative
mortality rates were 29.9% (59/197) and 13.7% (56/409) in the sarcopenic and
non-sarcopenic groups, respectively. Survival analysis showed that the asthmatic
population in the sarcopenia group showed a higher risk of death than the
non-sarcopenia group (HR 2.49, 95% CI 1.74-3.57, P < 0.001). In the subgroup
analyses, there was an interaction between the effects of cardiovascular disease
and sarcopenia on the mortality risk of asthma. Linear mixed modeling results
showed that asthmatics with sarcopenia had lower lung function (P < 0.001), and
that this effect did not change over time.
CONCLUSIONS: The results showed a significant association between sarcopenia and
higher mortality events and lower lung function in the asthmatic population.

A large proportion of women with asthma experience worsening of asthma during
pregnancy. Well-controlled asthma during pregnancy decreases risk of maternal
and foetal complications. Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) are part of
treatment guidelines for poorly controlled asthma. There are no clinical safety
data available on LAMA and short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMA) use in
pregnancy. The aim was to evaluate asthma control and pregnancy outcomes in
pregnant women with asthma using muscarinic antagonists.A prospective
observational cohort of pregnant women with asthma referred to the asthma
pregnancy outpatient clinic of the Haga Hospital, between 2018 and 2023, was
obtained and retrospectively analysed. Women using muscarinic antagonists were
included. Outcomes were asthma control, asthma exacerbations and pregnancy
outcomes.Fourteen (8.9%) of 158 recruited pregnant women used muscarinic
antagonists. Most women had poor asthma control with a mean (±SD) asthma control
questionnaire (ACQ) score of 2.4 (±1.3). Six (43%) women experienced an asthma
exacerbation. One woman using LAMA throughout pregnancy had pre-eclampsia
resulting in preterm birth, low birth weight and neonatal hospitalization.
Another child was born with low birth weight and was small for gestational age.
Two women developed maternal fever.A minority of women with asthma used
muscarinic antagonists during pregnancy. Despite the use of muscarinic
antagonists, asthma control remained poor during pregnancy. There were no major
adverse pregnancy outcomes or congenital malformations in this case series.
Since well-controlled asthma during pregnancy leads to fewer complications,
pregnant woman with poorly controlled asthma on ICS/LABA should be encouraged to
continue add-on asthma medication.

BACKGROUND: Methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) is known to play a role in asthma
airway remodeling and cell proliferation. Adenylate kinase 4 (AK4) regulates the
proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and exerts its effects
through the protein kinase B (AKT) pathway. However, the role of METTL3 and
AK4-AKT in bronchial smooth muscle cells remains unclear.
METHODS: Systemic METTL3 knockout mice and a mouse model of asthma were
established. Airway remodeling was assessed using pulmonary function tests,
histopathological staining, and Western blot analysis. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
was performed to detect changes in gene expression following METTL3 knockdown.
The 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay was used to evaluate cell
proliferation. Finally, the expression levels of relevant proteins were
validated by Western blotting.
RESULTS: Compared with the control model group, the METTL3 knockout group showed
significantly reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, decreased collagen fiber
deposition, and attenuated airway smooth muscle hyperplasia. RNA-seq revealed
that the expression of numerous proliferation-related genes, including AK4, was
upregulated following METTL3 knockdown. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) analysis indicated that these genes were primarily enriched in the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway. The EdU assay
demonstrated that METTL3 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation. Western blot
validation showed increased AK4 expression in lung tissues of the METTL3
knockout group compared to the control group, while phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT)
levels were reduced.
CONCLUSION: METTL3 knockout inhibits airway smooth muscle hyperplasia and
alleviates airway remodeling in asthma. This effect may be mediated through the
regulation of AK4 and the AKT signaling pathway.

Recent studies have suggested an increased incidence of various lung diseases
following COVID-19 vaccination. However, causal relationships have not been
definitively established. We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR)
study using publicly available genome-wide association study data to investigate
potential causal relationships between COVID-19 vaccination status as the
exposure and 14 different lung diseases as outcomes. The analytical methods
included random-effects inverse-variance weighting, MR Egger, and weighted
median, with additional heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses. Seven
instrumental variables for exposure were selected (P < 5 × 10-8). MR analyses
revealed that COVID-19 vaccination status was not associated with an increased
risk of developing overall lung cancer (P = .78), lung adenocarcinoma
(P = .557), squamous cell lung cancer (P = .557), non-small cell lung cancer
(P = .173), asthma (P = .905), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
bronchiectasis (P = .669), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume
in 1 second/FVC (P = .794), pneumonia (P = .282), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
(P = .486), pulmonary embolism (P = .267), pneumothorax (P = .73), or
sarcoidosis (P = .732). Evidence of heterogeneity was observed in the
inverse-variance weighting model for overall lung cancer, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, and FVC, whereas no indications of horizontal pleiotropy or
significant heterogeneity were noted for other lung diseases. COVID-19
vaccination does not appear to increase the risk of developing various lung
diseases. These findings support the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in terms of
respiratory health, reinforcing their role in public health interventions and
vaccination policies.

BACKGROUND: India's ageing population presents new health challenges,
particularly the rising burden of lung diseases like Asthma and COPD among
middle-aged and older adults. These conditions weaken individuals and heighten
the risk of geriatric complications. Understanding their interplay with
socio-economic, demographic, and household factors is essential for informed
public health interventions.
OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: This study investigates the growing burden of Asthma and
COPD among Indian individuals aged 45 years and above using LASI Wave 1 data.
Unadjusted prevalence was calculated across predictor variables. Poisson
regression identified factors associated with Asthma and COPD, while logistic
regression examined their unadjusted and adjusted associations with geriatric
syndromes.
RESULTS: The study reveals that the prevalence of Asthma and COPD among
individuals aged 45 years and above is 4.38% and 2.1%. It reveals distinct yet
overlapping risk patterns for both Asthma and COPD. For both diseases, the risk
increases significantly with age, particularly for those aged 60 years and
above, and is higher among wealthier individuals and those belonging to SC, OBC,
or non-classified social groups. Women are less likely to suffer from both
diseases, while discontinued smoking elevates the risk for both. Employment
status influences both conditions differently, those currently working are less
likely to have COPD and Asthma. Household factors such as the absence of a
separate kitchen increase the risk for both diseases. Cooking on open fires and
exposure to passive smoking significantly heighten the risk of COPD. Regional
variations persist, with lower risk in the North-East and elevated risks in the
South. Both diseases show significant association with geriatric syndromes such
as ADL (1.418 for Asthma and 1.424 for COPD), IADL (1.587 for Asthma and 1.542
for COPD), and Falls ((1.172 for Asthma and 1.320 for COPD)), after adjusting
for various individual and household determinants.
CONCLUSION: The study reveals complex relationships between social, individual
and household factors, chronic lung diseases (Asthma and COPD), and age-related
complications in India's older population.It highlights the need for targeted
treatments addressing both lung diseases and geriatric complications, guiding
policymakers in framing healthcare policies to promote healthy aging in India's
diverse older population.

BACKGROUND: The inflammatory response is critical in Human Rhinovirus (HRV)
infection-related acute asthma attacks, but its biological mechanisms remain
unclear. The interleukin-23 (IL-23)/T helper 17 (Th17) pathway is a key
inflammatory pathway that regulates abnormal inflammatory responses. Therefore,
this study aims to investigate the role of the IL-23/Th17 pathway in the
pathogenesis of wheezing in children with HRV infection by examining the
expression of signaling molecules within this pathway.
METHOD: Seventy-five pediatric patients hospitalized with HRV infection and 21
healthy children (as a control group) were randomly enrolled from Hangzhou
Children's Hospital between July 2022 and November 2023. HRV-infected patients
were stratified into wheezing (n = 42) and non-wheezing (n = 33) groups based on
wheezing symptoms. Nasopharyngeal swabs and peripheral venous blood samples were
collected on admission. An additional set of peripheral venous blood samples was
collected from 22 children in the wheezing group during their recovery phase
(day 7 after symptom onset). Th17 cell percentages in peripheral blood
lymphocytes were determined using flow cytometry. ELISA was utilized to measure
the serum levels of IL-23 and IL-17 and the expression of IL-23R, JAK2, p-JAK2,
STAT3, and p-STAT3 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Comparisons of
expression levels were made among the wheezing, non-wheezing, and control
groups, as well as between the acute and recovery phases in the wheezing group.
RESULTS: Children with wheezing due to HRV infection exhibited significantly
higher levels of IL-23 and IL-17 compared to the non-wheezing and control groups
(p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in the expression of other
molecules in the IL-23/Th17 pathway across the groups (p > 0.05). During the
recovery phase, the levels of IL-23 and IL-17 significantly decreased compared
to the acute phase (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: IL-23 and IL-17 significantly contribute to the development of
HRV-associated wheezing in children. However, the IL-23/Th17 pathway may not be
the primary mechanism behind HRV-related wheezing illnesses.

BACKGROUND: Pediatric obesity, a risk factor for asthma, is increasing in
prevalence. Obesity-mediated metabolic abnormalities are one of the mechanisms
that link asthma and obesity. While maternal obesity contributes to obesity and
respiratory morbidity in the child, the contribution of paternal obesity and
parental metabolic abnormalities to the child's asthma is not known.
METHODS: To quantify the impact of parental and child's body weight and
metabolic traits, including elevated HbA1c, and blood cholesterol levels based
on national, age-specific cut-off values, on asthma exacerbations, control, and
severity, in a Danish nationwide cohort of 29,851 children aged 2-17 years with
inhaled corticosteroid-treated asthma during 2015-17.
RESULTS: Among the 29,851 children, 1,430 had severe asthma, 4,750 had poor
asthma control, and 2,353 had exacerbating asthma. Elevated LDL in the child was
associated with 2.2-fold higher odds of severe asthma and elevated triglycerides
with 1.5-fold higher odds of exacerbating asthma, while reduced HDL was
associated with 1.5-fold higher odds of poor control. Both triglycerides and HDL
were associated with 1.5-fold higher odds of exacerbating asthma. Maternal
parameters including elevated LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and HbA1C were
associated with 1.2 to 1.4-fold higher odds of uncontrolled asthma in the child.
Elevated paternal HbA1C was associated with exacerbating asthma.
CONCLUSION: Dyslipidemia, including elevated LDL and decreased HDL, in the child
and their parents was associated with high asthma burden in a Danish pediatric
cohort with persistent asthma. These observations highlight the need to
investigate the underlying mechanisms driven by fat metabolism that are
transgenerational.

The pulmonary route has gained significant attention as a drug delivery method,
particularly for managing respiratory diseases. This approach provides several
benefits, such as rapid therapeutic action, minimized systemic exposure,
improved patient adherence, and the ability to deliver high drug concentrations
directly to the lungs. Advances in inhalation devices, including pressurized
metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs), dry powder inhalers (DPIs), and nebulizers, have
established the pulmonary route as effective for administering both
small-molecule drugs and complex biologics. Recent research has showcased the
successful use of inhaled biologics such as monoclonal antibodies, nanobodies,
and protein-based treatments in conditions like asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis, COVID-19, and respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV). These treatments employ innovative mechanisms, such as
muco-trapping and immune modulation, to optimize site-specific drug delivery and
minimize systemic side effects. As technologies for pulmonary administration
continue to evolve, they provide a non-invasive and highly promising platform
for enhancing respiratory therapies and broadening the applications of
biologics.

PURPOSE: To assess the association between social determinants of health (SDoH)
and both mortality and pulmonary outcomes in infants with congenital
diaphragmatic hernia (CDH).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of all patients
with CDH at our institution from January 2004 to July 2023. Child opportunity
index (COI) and area deprivation index (ADI) were determined from reported
addresses at birth. Baseline demographics and details from initial
hospitalization were described by COI quintiles. Outcomes of mortality and
CDH-associated pulmonary outcomes were compared between COI quintiles.
RESULTS: Among the 281 patients, there were unequal distributions of race
(p<0.001) and ethnicity (p=0.006) among the COI quintiles, with Black patients
comprising a quarter of the very low COI quintile. In-hospital mortality,
supplemental oxygen at discharge, reactive airway disease (RAD)/asthma, and
differed significantly among the COI quintiles (p=0.02, p=0.024, p=0.04).
Multivariable regression analyses of composite outcomes (mortality or pulmonary
comorbidities) demonstrated those in the very high vs. very low COI quintile had
20-31% lower odds of requiring oxygen (O2) support and having pulmonary
hypertension (PH) at discharge (p=0.006, p=0.029) and at 6 months (p=0.01,
p=0.003), respectively. ADI similarly correlated with need for O2 support and PH
in CDH infants at 6 months, AOR 1.03 (95% CI 1.01-1.04), p=0.001 and 1.02 (95%
CI 1-1.03), p=0.029, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Children of very low COI and higher ADI with CDH may be at increased
risk of mortality or pulmonary morbidities. Further studies are needed to better
characterize this vulnerable population and to improve these SDoH-related
disparities in CDH outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the diagnostic utility of spirometry and
impulse oscillometry, focusing on their correlation and diagnostic advantages,
in children with cough variant asthma (CVA).
METHODS: This study included children aged 5-12 years with a diagnosis of CVA
who underwent sequential IOS and spirometry pulmonary function with
bronchodilation (BD) tests. A control group of healthy children was matched.
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted, and the area under
the curve (AUC) was calculated to assess the discriminatory potential of these
spirometry and IOS parameters for CVA. The correlation and diagnostic
consistency between spirometry and IOS parameters were compared.
RESULTS: A total of 177 patients with CVA and 45 control subjects were included.
The ROC curve results for pre-BD parameters and the improvement rate showed that
the combinations of "pre-MMEF(%pred) and △MMEF" and "pre-Z5(%pred) and -△Z5(%)"
achieved the highest AUC value of 0.892 and 0.836, with threshold probabilities
of 0.868, 0.786, respectively. The AUC values of these combined parameters
surpassed those of individual ones. The correlation between spirometry and IOS
parameters showed that pre-FEF25(%pred) has a moderately negative correlation
with pre-Z5(%pred) and pre-R5(%pred) (r=-0.415, -0.404; P< 0.001), △FEF75% has a
weak positive correlation with -△Z5%, -△R5%(r=0.154, 0.155; P< 0.05). The
comparison of diagnostic consistency between pre-BD spirometry and pre-BD IOS
parameters showed a weak correlation(kappa=0.150, P=0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: The changes in spirometry and IOS parameters during the BD test
provided valuable diagnostic information for CVA and can help pediatricians
accurately identify CVA in children.

With the prevalence of pediatric asthma and allergy rising substantially since
last mid-century, birth cohort studies starting in pregnancy have been pivotal
in identifying prenatal and early life environmental factors that influence risk
of these diseases. With these findings, researchers have been able to identify
biological mechanisms at play with the eventual goal of engineering tailored
interventions to optimize immune system development and decrease the risk of
allergic disorders. In this review, we describe the critical role birth cohort
studies have played in starting to disentangle the environmental epidemiology
and etiology of childhood-onset asthma and other allergic diseases, and how
these studies have guided ongoing clinical trials for asthma and allergy
prevention. Lastly, we highlight important questions that remain unanswered and
potential approaches to help fill these gaps in knowledge.

Changes of pollen allergens in northern China.
Qi W, Bian S, Li L, Guan K.
BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a significant global health issue, with
pollen allergens being a major cause of seasonal AR and asthma. In northern
China, the prevalence of pollen-related allergies is notably higher than in the
south due to higher pollen levels. Over the past few decades, climate change and
urbanization have considerably transformed pollen profile in northern China.
SUMMARY: Northern China experiences two annual pollen peaks: a spring peak
(March to May) dominated by tree pollens (e.g., Cupressaceae, Ulmaceae) and a
summer/autumn peak (August to September) dominated by weed pollens, particularly
from Artemisia, Humulus, and Chenopodiaceae. Climate change has accelerated the
onset of flowering periods, increased pollen production, and extended pollen
seasons, with extreme weather events and air pollution further exacerbating
pollen production and sensitization. Urbanization has increased tree pollens,
resulting in spring peak pollen levels gradually exceeding those of
summer/autumn in most northern regions. As ecological construction concepts have
advanced, the selection of plant species for the shelterbelt and ornamental
trees in cities has evolved, leads to changes in the dominant pollens in the
north and northeast. Artemisia has been extensively planted in the Northwest for
windbreak and sand fixation purposes, resulting in a significant rise in
Artemisia pollen levels and sensitization rate with a widespread influence
across northern China.
KEY MESSAGES: Pollen allergens in northern China are a major driver of AR and
asthma, with two distinct seasonal peaks. Changes in pollen profiles are
influenced by natural factors such as geographical location and climate change,
as well as social factors, including urbanization, national policies, and urban
planning. In northern China, Spring pollen is predominantly composed of tree
pollens, significantly influenced by urban planning across different regions. In
contrast, summer and autumn pollen is primarily dominated by weed and grass
pollens, with weed pollens exhibiting strong allergenic potential and widespread
dispersal. The Northwest region is a major potential source for these weed
pollens.

Myositis Associated With Eosinophilic Granulomatosis With Polyangiitis
Demonstrated by FDG PET/CT.
Yamada K(1), Hotta M.
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine and Radiology, National Center for Global
Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.
A 54-year-old woman with a history of adult-onset asthma presented with
prolonged fever, rash, joint pain, and hypesthesia. Laboratory findings showed
elevated eosinophils (22%). FDG PET/CT demonstrated uptake in consolidations in
both lungs, consistent with eosinophilic pneumonia, and revealed systemic
myositis with increased uptake (SUVmax 5.5) in muscles, predominantly in the
lower extremities. Based on the 2022 ACR/EULAR criteria, she was diagnosed with
eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). This case highlights the
value of FDG PET/CT in demonstrating eosinophilic pneumonia and in myositis
associated with EGPA, suggesting its potential role in diagnosing EGPA in
patients with fever of unknown origin.

BACKGROUND: Aluminum is used as an adjuvant in nonlive vaccines administered in
early childhood. Concerns persist about potential associations between
vaccination with aluminum-adsorbed vaccines and increased risk for chronic
autoimmunity, atopy or allergy, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Large-scale
safety data remain limited.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between cumulative aluminum exposure from
early childhood vaccination and risk for autoimmune, atopic or allergic, and
neurodevelopmental disorders.
DESIGN: A cohort study linking nationwide registry data on childhood
vaccinations, outcome diagnoses, and potential confounders, leveraging the
variations in the aluminum content of childhood vaccines over time.
SETTING: Denmark, 1997 to 2020.
PARTICIPANTS: 1 224 176 children born in Denmark between 1997 and 2018 who were
alive and residing in the country at age 2 years.
INTERVENTION: Cumulative aluminum amount received (per 1-mg increase) through
vaccination during the first 2 years of life.
MEASUREMENTS: Incident events of 50 chronic disorders, including autoimmune
(dermatologic, endocrinologic, hematologic, gastrointestinal, and rheumatic),
atopic or allergic (asthma, atopic dermatitis, rhinoconjunctivitis, and
allergy), and neurodevelopmental (autism spectrum disorder and attention
deficit-hyperactivity disorder).
RESULTS: Cumulative aluminum exposure from vaccination during the first 2 years
of life was not associated with increased rates of any of the 50 disorders
assessed. For groups of combined outcomes, adjusted hazard ratios per 1-mg
increase in aluminum exposure were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.94 to 1.02) for any
autoimmune disorder, 0.99 (CI, 0.98 to 1.01) for any atopic or allergic
disorder, and 0.93 (CI, 0.90 to 0.97) for any neurodevelopmental disorder. For
most individually analyzed outcomes, the upper bounds of the 95% CIs were
incompatible with relative increases greater than 10% or 30%.
LIMITATION: Individual medical records were not reviewed.
CONCLUSION: This nationwide cohort study did not find evidence supporting an
increased risk for autoimmune, atopic or allergic, or neurodevelopmental
disorders associated with early childhood exposure to aluminum-adsorbed
vaccines. For most outcomes, the findings were inconsistent with moderate to
large relative increases in risk, although small relative effects, particularly
for some rarer disorders, could not be statistically excluded.

Presentations of status asthmaticus or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease exacerbation can present a formidable challenge to effective invasive
ventilation. The optimal ventilation strategy targets low respiratory rates and
high inspiratory flow rates to prolong the expiratory time and minimize dynamic
hyperinflation. Although the resulting high peak pressures can usually be
accommodated by ICU ventilators, some ventilators have a relatively limited peak
pressure capacity as determined by the turbine. Here, we describe two cases of
severe airflow obstruction where the desired ventilation strategy required a
peak pressure over the capacity of the Hamilton T1 transport ventilator.
Changing to a pressure regulated strategy, maximizing the driving pressure, and
titrating the inspiratory time overcame the limitation. But, this strategy comes
at a cost. Clinicians should be made aware of the possibility of a pressure
limitation in their ventilator and understand how to adjust their ventilation
strategy appropriately during transitions.

Tape-stripping, a skin sampling technique that uses adhesives to collect cells
from the stratum corneum, offers a minimally invasive method that provides
valuable molecular insights into various skin and systemic diseases. Initially
developed in the 1930s, tape stripping has evolved from a research tool into a
validated method for omics research in clinical settings. In dermatology, tape
strips have been validated to study chronic inflammatory skin disorders, such as
atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and hidradenitis suppurativa, as well as various
cutaneous malignancies, providing insight into pathophysiology, aiding in
disease differentiation, and tracking treatment response. Tape strips circumvent
the pain, scarring, infection risk, and follow-up requirements associated with
traditional skin biopsies. Moreover, tape strips allow for higher enrollment
rates for clinical trials and longitudinal studies, especially in the pediatric
population where biopsies are particularly challenging. This tool has enabled
researchers and clinicians to monitor disease activity and evaluate therapeutic
response, especially in patients who cannot tolerate repetitive biopsies. Beyond
skin conditions, tape strips are also being used to advance biomarker research
in food allergy, asthma, and other systemic and autoimmune diseases, and to
assess epidermal and skin barrier restoration and transepithelial water loss
(TEWL). By facilitating data collection across diverse patient populations, tape
strips are an important technological advancement towards precision medicine. As
this technology continues to improve, tape stripping promises to become an asset
in diagnosing and monitoring a wide range of diseases.

IMPORTANCE: While biologic therapies targeting type 2 (T2) inflammation reduce
acute exacerbation rates in children with asthma and T2 inflammation,
exacerbations still occur, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly
defined.
OBJECTIVE: To identify multiple distinct molecular mechanisms implicated in
asthma exacerbations by characterizing respiratory illnesses among urban
children with eosinophilic asthma enrolled in a clinical trial comparing
treatment with mepolizumab vs placebo.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a secondary analysis of the
Mechanisms Underlying Asthma Exacerbations Prevented and Persistent With
Immune-Based Therapy: A Systems Approach Phase 2 (MUPPITS-2) double-blind,
placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial comparing
treatment with mepolizumab vs placebo among children with exacerbation-prone
asthma in low-income urban centers in 9 US cities. Data analysis was performed
from September 2022 to April 2025.
INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized to receive either mepolizumab (aged
6-11 years: 40 mg; aged 12-17 years: 100 mg) or matching placebo by subcutaneous
injection once every 4 weeks for 52 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary measurement was a transcriptomic modular
analysis by RNA sequencing of nasal samples obtained during acute respiratory
illnesses. Associations among upper airway transcriptional signatures, the
clinical outcome of respiratory illnesses, and pulmonary functions were
investigated.
RESULTS: Of the 290 participants enrolled in the MUPPITS-2 trial, 108
participants (median [IQR] age, 10.0 [9.0-13.0] years; 48 [44%] female) were
sampled during 176 acute respiratory illness events. During illness events
resulting in asthma exacerbations, children receiving mepolizumab demonstrated
decreased expression of an eosinophil-associated module associated with T2
inflammation (log2 fold change [FC] estimate, -0.60; false discovery rate
[FDR] < .05) but increased expression of gene modules associated with epithelial
and macrophage inflammatory pathways relative to children receiving placebo
(log2 FC estimates, 0.22-0.85; FDR < .05). Both groups showed higher expression
of mucus secretion and cellular stress response pathways during exacerbations
relative to nonexacerbation illnesses. The mepolizumab group demonstrated
upregulation of epithelial inflammatory pathways in exacerbations irrespective
of a respiratory virus, while macrophage pathways contributed specifically to
viral exacerbations. Three distinct, semiorthogonal inflammatory axes were shown
to underlie the majority of the heterogeneity among exacerbations in the 2
groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The study's findings implicate multiple alternative
inflammatory pathways associated with the epithelium and macrophages, as well as
mucus hypersecretion, as mechanisms of residual acute exacerbations in children
receiving mepolizumab. Further, they indicate that multiple distinct
inflammatory axes can independently contribute to asthma exacerbations.

Adolescent smoking and asthma are major global public health concerns. This
study aims to comprehensively assess the impact of smoking on asthma control,
pulmonary function, and risk factors for uncontrolled asthma in adolescents. A
total of 126 adolescents aged 10 to 18 years were categorized into three groups:
(1) smoking asthmatics, (2) non-smoking asthmatics, and (3) smoking
non-asthmatics. Asthma symptom control was determined according to the Global
Initiative for Asthma (GINA). Demographic and clinical characteristics,
pulmonary function test (PFT) results, and healthcare utilization data were
compared across the groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression
analyses were performed to identify risk factors for uncontrolled asthma.
Smoking asthmatics exhibited significantly lower FEV₁%, FEF₂₅₋₇₅%, and PEF%
values compared to non-smoking asthmatics (p = 0.042, p = 0.045, p = 0.002,
respectively). The prevalence of uncontrolled asthma was significantly higher in
smoking asthmatics (p = 0.005). Additionally, short-acting bronchodilator use in
the past year (p = 0.004) and hospital admissions and/or emergency department
visits due to breathlessness (p < 0.001) were significantly increased in this
group. In multivariate analysis, current smoking status (OR = 4.973, 95%
CI:1.120-22.089, p = 0.035), lower FEV₁% (OR = 1.155, 95% CI:1.077-1.240,
p < 0.001), and atopic status (OR = 3.977, 95% CI:1.100-14.382, p = 0.035)
emerged as independent predictors of poor asthma control.
CONCLUSION: These findings highlight smoking as a key determinant of worsened
pulmonary function, poor asthma control, and increased healthcare utilization
among adolescents with asthma. The results underscore the urgent need for
smoking cessation strategies in this population, emphasizing their crucial role
in preventing long-term pulmonary function decline and improving clinical
outcomes.
WHAT IS KNOWN: • Smoking increases asthma severity and reduces treatment
response. However, its specific effects on asthma control and lung function in
adolescents remain underexplored.
WHAT IS NEW: • This study shows that adolescent smokers have significantly
higher rates of uncontrolled asthma, make more frequent visits to the emergency
department, and use bronchodilators more often. Smoking, reduced FEV₁%, and
atopic status were identified as independent predictors of poor asthma control.
These findings highlight the importance of early spirometric evaluation and
targeted smoking cessation strategies for adolescents.

The rising global energy demand and environmental concerns necessitate the
development of sustainable energy-harvesting technologies. Among these,
moisture-enabled nanogenerators (MEGs) have emerged as a promising solution,
harnessing ubiquitous moisture in the environment to generate clean energy. MEGs
operate through diffusion-induced micro- or nanofluidic proton transport between
two electrodes; however, existing devices often produce only transient outputs.
Addressing this limitation, we developed a biocompatible MEG utilizing a
quasi-solid gelatin matrix and a 2D SnS2-based composite, delivering a
continuous open-circuit voltage of 0.95 V, a short-circuit current of 241.6 μA,
and a power density of approximately 358.6 μW/cm2 at 90% relative humidity (RH).
Furthermore, the device demonstrates the capability to generate electricity from
human breath and hand proximity, opening avenues for self-powered medical
devices. The fast response of humidity makes it suitable for health monitoring
applications in conditions such as sleep apnea, asthma, and respiratory
disorders. A comparative performance analysis with other protein/2D
material-based MEGs highlights the superior efficiency and stability of our
device. The integration of gelatin with SnS2 enhances energy output while
maintaining environmental friendliness, paving the way for next-generation
autonomous electronics. This study underscores the potential of biocompatible
MEGs in addressing energy challenges through innovative and sustainable
approaches.

Apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1), the major protein of high-density lipoproteins, has
anti-inflammatory functions. APOA1 is primarily produced in the liver, however,
it is not known whether neutrophils are a cellular source. Here, we assessed
whether human neutrophils express APOA1. Peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid (BALF) were obtained from healthy volunteers (HVs) and asthmatics.
Peripheral blood neutrophils from HVs expressed APOA1 at both the mRNA and
protein levels, while confocal microscopy demonstrated that APOA1 was localized
to a unique population of intracytoplasmic granules. In HVs and asthmatics,
APOA1 was preferentially expressed by neutrophils with high side-scatter
(SSChigh) in blood and BALF. Furthermore, APOA1+ SSChigh neutrophils were
characterized as a population with high levels of caspase-3/7 activation and
CCR5 expression. Since APOA1 has anti-inflammatory functions, this suggests that
APOA1 expression by neutrophils may represent a mechanism to attenuate excessive
inflammatory responses in health and disease.

Epithelial tissues form barriers to the flow of ions, nutrients, waste products,
bacteria, and viruses. The conventional electrophysiology measurement of
transepithelial resistance (TEER/TER) can quantify epithelial barrier integrity,
but does not capture all the electrical behavior of the tissue or provide
insight into membrane-specific properties. Electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy, in addition to measurement of TER, enables measurement of
transepithelial capacitance (TEC) and a ratio of electrical time constants for
the tissue, which we term the membrane ratio. This protocol describes how to
perform galvanostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy on epithelia using
commercially available cell culture inserts and chambers, detailing the
apparatus, electrical signal, fitting technique, and error quantification. The
measurement can be performed in under 1 min on commercially available cell
culture inserts and electrophysiology chambers using instrumentation capable of
galvanostatic sinusoidal signal processing (4 μA amplitude, 2 Hz to 50 kHz). All
fits to the model have less than 10 Ω mean absolute error, revealing repeatable
values distinct for each cell type. On representative retinal pigment (n = 3)
and bronchiolar epithelial samples (n = 4), TER measurements were 500-667 Ω·cm2
and 955-1,034 Ω·cm2 (within the expected range), TEC measurements were 3.65-4.10
μF/cm2 and 1.07-1.10 μF/cm2, and membrane ratio measurements were 18-22 and
1.9-2.2, respectively. Key features • This protocol requires preexisting
experience with culturing epithelial cells (such as Caco-2, RPE, and 16HBE) for
a successful outcome. • Builds upon methods by Lewallen et al. [1] and Linz et
al. [2], integrating commercial chambers and providing a quantitative estimate
of error. • Provides code to run measurement, process data, and report error;
requires access to MATLAB software, but no coding experience is necessary. •
Allows for repeated measurements on the same sample. Graphical overview
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement involves sending a
galvanostatic signal through the electrophysiology chamber and across the
epithelial cell monolayer (left) and results in complex impedance data at each
frequency. This data is then fit to an electrical circuit model to output
transepithelial resistance (TER), transepithelial capacitance (TEC), and
membrane ratio (α) (right).

BACKGROUND: Chronic airway inflammation in asthma and/or chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) is presumed to be protumorigenic. The tumor inhibitory
effect of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) used to reduce airway inflammation in
patients with asthma and COPD remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of coexisting asthma and/or
COPD on the survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. The effects of ICS
treatment were also assessed.
DESIGN: This retrospective, real-world cohort study was conducted at a cancer
center.
METHODS: The overall survival of a cohort of 1524 consecutive patients with lung
adenocarcinoma who were enrolled between January 2011 and December 2019 and
followed up until December 2022 was analyzed, followed by subgroup comparisons.
RESULTS: A total of 283 patients had coexisting asthma and/or COPD. Among them,
212 had used ICSs. ICS users were predominantly women, older, and had more
advanced-stage disease; moreover, there were fewer tobacco smokers, fewer
comorbidities, and relatively severe obstructive impairments than non-ICS users.
When restricted to stage 0-II diseases, patients with coexisting asthma and/or
COPD had a lower 5-year overall survival rate (77% vs 90%, p < 0.001), with a
hazard ratio of 1.8, in contrast to no difference among patients with stage
III-IV disease. ICS users had a lower 5-year overall survival rate in both
subgroups, although the difference was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: The impact of cancer on prognosis may overwhelm the effects of
asthma and/or COPD in patients with advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma. The
evaluation of the effects of ICS treatment appears to be confounded by intent
and compliance, which can introduce bias in the opposite direction. However,
investigating the treatment effects on asthma and/or COPD control would be
beneficial. A systematic prospective study is required to define the role of the
ICS.

BACKGROUND: Asthma poses a significant global health challenge, representing a
chronic respiratory disorder marked by airway inflammation. The advanced lung
cancer inflammation index (ALI) served as a comprehensive index to assess
inflammation. However, few studies have investigated the association between ALI
and both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in US patients with asthma.
METHODS: We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) to explore the association of ALI with all-cause and cardiovascular
mortality in US patients with asthma. This study used Kaplan-Meier curves to
examine the ALI index's impact on asthma patients' survival. We applied weighted
Cox models and restricted cubic splines (RCS) analysis to assess the
ALI-mortality link, identifying non-linear thresholds with a recursive
algorithm. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted, excluding
those with missing covariates and cancer patients.
RESULTS: A total of 6,211 asthma patients were enrolled and categorized into
three groups based on ALI tertiles. The risk of all-cause mortality decreased as
ALI increased in the fully adjusted multivariate Cox regression analysis; the
hazard ratio (HR) is 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91-0.99, P = 0.01). Compared with the
lowest ALI group, T1, the fully adjusted HR values for ALI and all-cause
mortality in T2, T3 were 0.68 (95% CI: 0.55-0.85, P < 0.001), 0.53 (95% CI:
0.41-0.68, P < 0.001). The risk of cardiovascular mortality was also lower in
the groups of T2 (HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.55-1.28) and T3 (HR: 0.47, 95% CI:
0.31-0.71, P for trend < 0.001), respectively. In addition, the results of the
subgroup analyses were robust.
CONCLUSIONS: This cohort study demonstrated the higher accuracy of ALI in
predicting mortality in asthma patients, highlighting its important clinical
value of ALI in risk assessment and prognosis evaluation.

BACKGROUND: There is no consensus on the definition of clinical stability in
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and it is less frequently used as
a treatment target compared to severe asthma. The factors that determine
clinical stability and their effects on mortality are less well-studied in
patients with COPD.
METHODS: To address this gap, we conducted a prospective longitudinal cohort
study to identify predictors of two-year clinical stability, defined as no
exacerbations and stable symptoms (<2 point change in CAT score from baseline),
and the impact of comorbid cardiovascular disease (CVD) on clinical stability
and mortality in COPD patients.
RESULTS: A total of 463 patients (mean age 71 ± 9 years) were enrolled in this
study. The cohort was predominantly Chinese (81.7%) and 45.6% of participants
were current smokers. The majority (55.7%) had a history of CVD. Approximately
36% of the cohort achieved clinical stability at one year, and one-third
achieved stability at two years. Predictors of 2-year clinical stability
included higher body mass index (BMI) (p<0.001), higher post-bronchodilator
FEV1/FVC ratio (p=0.0132), fewer baseline exacerbations (p=0.007), absence of
bronchiectasis (p=0.045), preserved hemoglobin levels (p=0.019), and successful
smoking cessation (p=0.039). Notably, while 2-year clinical stability did not
predict subsequent mortality, the presence of CVD was a significant predictor of
5-years mortality (HR 1.48, 95% CI 0.99-2.22; p=0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our study identified several predictors of 2-year clinical stability
in patients with COPD. However, clinical stability at 2 years did not predict
subsequent mortality. These findings suggest that clinical stability and
mortality are distinct outcomes that are driven by different sets of predictive
variables. This underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to COPD
management that not only addresses exacerbations and symptoms, but also
considers a broader range of factors influencing survival, particularly the
management of comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease.

BACKGROUND: Mite, cockroach, and shellfish (crab, clam, and shrimp) proteins
share allergenic epitopes. The determination of specific IgE (sIgE) against
cockroach (Blattella germanica, relevant in asthma) and shellfish allergens
(relevant in food allergy) using whole-body extracts necessitates detailed
knowledge of IgE cross-reactivity.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate whether cross-reactivity between
aeroallergens and food allergens is clinically relevant and whether subjects
with mite and/or cockroach sensitization are at risk of false-positive results
in shellfish food allergy diagnostics.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional, single-center study, we recruited 200 patients
with elevated sIgE against ≥1 allergen at random from our outpatient clinic and
assessed allergic comorbidity. We analyzed sIgE against mites (Dermatophagoides
pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, or Blomia tropicalis), German cockroach
(B. germanica), crab, clam, and shrimp whole allergen extract, as well as sIgE
against mite tropomyosin Der p 10 and shrimp tropomyosin Pen a 1 (in a
subpopulation), using automated ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Tests.
RESULTS: During allergologic assessment, two participants reported previous
anaphylaxis to fish and/or seafood and were excluded from further analysis. The
final study population comprised 150 female and 48 male participants. Of these,
93 presented with positive sIgE against mites. As expected, participants with
mite sensitization displayed an elevated prevalence of perennial asthma or
allergic rhinitis (p < 0.001). Further, they were more often sensitized to
German cockroach, crab, claw, or shrimp (each p < 0.001). Der p 10 and Pen a 1
sIgE levels were below the cutoff level (<0.35 kU/L) in all subjects. However,
the correlation analyses revealed that tropomyosin sIgE explained between 24%
and 55% of the variance (R2) in sIgE against clam, crab, German cockroach, or
shrimp (each p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Patients with mite sensitization have higher asymptomatic sIgE
levels to shellfish. Even in patients with anti-tropomyosin sIgE levels below

Phosphodiesterase 4 (i.e., PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D) is an enzyme group
that regulates intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which
are involved in multiple physiological activities. PDE4B and PDE4D have closely
identical amino acid sequences (~80%) and are highly expressed due to increases
in cAMP levels and other factors like hormones, neurotransmitters, etc. Thus,
selective PDE4B suppression and discovery of its inhibitors are quite
challenging. The PDE4B isoform, highly expressed in inflammatory disorders,
cancers, cognitive and metabolic disorders, represents a potential target for
therapy and drug discovery. PDE4B inhibition is what produces the positive
therapeutic results, whereas nonselective PDE4D inhibition leads to unfavorable
side effects. In the realm of modern research, selective PDE4B inhibition is
important and ought to be achieved to improve the safety and effectiveness of
its inhibitors. This article highlights the advances in the development of
selective PDE4BIs during the past decade. The chemical architecture for
selective inhibitors includes different functional groups capable of producing
the essential interactions with the catalytic domain of PDE4B. The In Silico
interaction analysis revealed the importance of PDE4BIs' interaction with the Q
(PHE-446 and GLU-443), M (Zn2+ and Mg2+), and S pockets, along with the CR3
domain of the enzyme. Additionally, a few of the natural products and their
derivatives are also being explored as PDE4BIs. Dual activities of the PDE4BIs,
i.e., PDE4B inhibition along with TRPA1 and M3 inhibition and β2 activation, are
the future perspective for the treatment of inflammatory diseases like
psoriasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, autoimmune
disorders, etc.

BACKGROUND: Pediatric asthma, as a chronic inflammatory condition, has been
associated with increased fracture risk due to persistent inflammation and
corticosteroid treatment. This study investigates the association between
pediatric asthma and fracture risk using data from the National Health Insurance
Service database of South Korea.
METHODS: Children born from 2002 to 2004 were selected for the analysis,
utilizing information from the Korean National Health Insurance Service National
Sample Cohort up to 2019. Exclusion criteria included asthma diagnosis before
age 6, history of prior fractures, and the presence of severe comorbidities.
Asthma cases were identified by the Korean Standard Classification of Diseases,
8th Revision (KCD-8) codes J45 and J46, and fractures were determined using all
relevant KCD-8 codes. Propensity score matching was used to balance demographic
and clinical characteristics between the asthma and non-asthma groups. Fracture
risk was analyzed using logistic regression models adjusted for covariates.
Within the asthma cohort, the analysis investigated corticosteroid exposure,
focusing on both recent and cumulative exposure to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)
and systemic corticosteroids within 1 year before the occurrence of fractures.
RESULTS: From an initial cohort of 30,409 children, 13,275 were included in the
final analysis, comprising 2325 asthma patients and 10,950 non-asthma controls.
Asthma was associated with a higher risk of fractures (Odds Ratio [OR]: 1.22,
95% CI: 1.12-1.34, p < .001). Among asthma patients, recent ICS use within
90 days before a fracture was linked to the highest risk (Adjusted Odds Ratio
[Adjusted OR]: 2.98, 95% CI: 2.95-3.05, p < .001). Systemic corticosteroid use
showed a dose-dependent relationship with increased fracture risk.
CONCLUSION: Pediatric asthma and corticosteroid treatment are both significantly
associated with elevated fracture risk. These results emphasize the necessity
for comprehensive asthma management strategies that prioritize bone health.

PURPOSE: The prevalence and economic burden of asthma across the public
healthcare landscape in Singapore is substantial, where the asthma patient
journey often transitions between primary care (PC) and specialty care (SC)
settings.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study used the SingHealth COPD and Asthma Data Mart,
a repository of clinical and administrative data from patients with asthma or
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, to collect real-time, real-world data
across a range of demographics, disease severities and treatment pathways.
RESULTS: Key differences were identified among patients treated in PC, SC, or
both (PC/SC). There were more patients of Chinese ethnicity and ex-smokers among
those treated in SC versus PC or PC/SC. Patients in SC also had a lower mean
Asthma Control Test score (17.93 [standard deviation: 4.92]) versus the other
groups (PC: 20.32 [4.37], p<0.001; PC/SC: 19.65 [4.55], p<0.001). More patients
used low-dose inhaled corticosteroids in the PC (76.95%) than SC group (60.1%).
Patients treated in PC/SC were older and had more frequent emergency department
visits (0.54 [1.17] vs PC: 0.04 [0.16], p<0.001; SC: 0.35 [0.92], p<0.001) and
exacerbations per patient/year (2.31 [3.37] vs PC: 1.48 [2.56], p<0.001; SC:
0.96 [2.67], p<0.001), and higher proportions had comorbidities versus PC or SC.
Overall, nearly half of patients had uncontrolled asthma, 58.88% of whom were in
the PC group.
CONCLUSION: Findings of this study provide greater understanding of the asthma
public healthcare landscape in Singapore, allowing for the identification of
current gaps in care, particularly for high-risk groups that may benefit from
optimised treatment.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease characterized by variable
respiratory symptoms and reversible airflow limitation. Despite significant
advances in pharmacologic and immunotherapeutic treatment, definitive remission
or cure remains elusive. Asthma remission is defined as a sustained absence of
symptoms, exacerbations, and lung function decline, with or without ongoing
therapy. In contrast, an asthma cure implies permanent disease eradication
marked by lifelong symptom resolution, no need for maintenance or rescue
medication, preserved lung function, and absence of airway inflammation. To
date, no intervention has been proven to cure asthma. Consequently, clinical
remission has emerged as a more achievable and meaningful goal in asthma
management. This review summarizes recent findings on remission rates, key
factors influencing asthma remission, and the impact of various therapeutic
strategies-including immunotherapy and advanced biologics. We also highlight
evidence underscoring the foundational role of comprehensive asthma care. Asthma
should be managed within the context of a unified allergic airway disease; thus,
systematic identification and treatment of coexisting conditions such as
allergic rhinitis and rhinosinusitis, nasal polyps is essential, as they often
exacerbate lower airway symptoms. Routine nasal irrigation, environmental
control measures, and attention to modifiable lifestyle factors-such as sleep
hygiene, physical activity, and weight management-are critical. When
consistently implemented, these holistic approaches may significantly improve
disease control and support the achievement of clinical remission. Achieving a
cure for asthma remains the ultimate goal, necessitating a long-term commitment
and strategically designed basic and clinical research to determine its
viability.

INTRODUCTION: Whether socioeconomic status is associated with pulmonary
conditions in BMT survivors is unknown. In this study, we used data from the BMT
Survivor Study (BMTSS) to determine the association between low annual household
income and adverse pulmonary conditions (asthma, chronic cough or dyspnea,
dyspnea at rest, recurrent pneumonia, current oxygen use) and health status in a
retrospective cohort of BMT survivors.
METHODS: BMTSS includes individuals who received BMT between 1974 and 2014 and
survived for ≥ 2y after BMT at one of three participating sites. BMT survivors
completed the BMTSS survey, providing details on demographics (including annual
household income) and chronic health conditions as diagnosed by their healthcare
providers. We used logistic regression models to determine the odds of low
annual household income (≤$49,999) associated with a post-BMT pulmonary
condition in BMT survivors, adjusting for relevant clinical and sociodemographic
variables.
RESULTS: Our analysis included 2,814 participants (median age 58y; 44% female;
75% non-Hispanic White). Compared to survivors with annual household income
≥$100,000, those with income ≤$49,999 had higher odds of pulmonary conditions
(asthma: OR = 1.80, 95%CI = 1.04-3.12, chronic cough or dyspnea: OR = 1.96,
95%CI = 1.37-2.81, and recurrent pneumonia: OR = 1.90, 95%CI = 1.00-3.60. Low
income was also associated with suboptimal health status (poor/fair/good:
OR = 2.36, 95%CI = 1.84-3.01; reference: very good/excellent).
CONCLUSIONS: The association between low annual household income and post-BMT
pulmonary compromise in BMT survivors presents a need to understand the
individual and environmental causes for this association. Future research should
evaluate interventions to prevent post-transplant pulmonary morbidity in the
lower-income survivor population.

BACKGROUND: Although current guidelines for asthma diagnosis and management have
proven relatively successful, many asthmatics continue to experience poor asthma
control and exacerbations. This may be due to a failure to recognize that mild,
well-controlled asthmatics commonly have small airway dysfunction (SAD), which
is associated with a significant exacerbation risk.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to better characterize how well SAD, determined by impulse
oscillometry (IOS), is associated with prior exacerbations in the GINA defined
mild, well-controlled asthma phenotype.
METHODS: In 170 adults with mild, well-controlled asthma we determined the
presence of SAD by IOS metrics of peripheral airway resistance between 5Hz and
20Hz (Rrs5 - Rrs20) and peripheral airway reactance as area under the reactance
curve (AX) at cut points of 0.10 kPa/L/s and 1.0 kPa/L respectively. We also
assessed the association between SAD, FEV1, FeNO, blood eosinophilia, and extra
fine inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with prior exacerbations. A multivariate
analysis evaluated which variables were independently associated with prior
exacerbations.
RESULTS: SAD was present in 27.6% and prior exacerbations in 34.1% of the
population. Exacerbations were greater in those with SAD (82.9% versus 15.4%, p
< .001), lower in those receiving extra fine ICS (27.7% versus 55.3% p< .05).
SAD and extra fine ICS were both independently associated with prior
exacerbations, with SAD increasing and extra fine ICS decreasing exacerbation
risk.
CONCLUSIONS: In the mild, well-controlled asthmatic, SAD and prior exacerbations
are common. SAD and extra fine ICS are independently associated with increased
or decreased exacerbations respectively. Detecting SAD could result in early
extra fine ICS intervention potentially preventing future exacerbations in this
phenotype.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, it has been found that Th1 inflammation
characterized by elevated levels of IFN-γ can be observed in the airways of
patients with severe asthma, accompanied by polarization of M1 macrophages.
However, the specific pathogenic role of M1 macrophages and their intrinsic
regulatory factors in the development of asthma is still unclear.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate whether CXCL10 regulates M1 macrophage
polarization through Sirt3.
METHODS: Collecting peripheral blood samples from asthmatic children, ELISA was
used to detect the levels of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, and Western blot
analyses was used to detect of the levels of Sirt3. We constructed an asthma
mouse model and observed changes in macrophage polarization and Sirt3 by
neutralizing CXCL10 or injecting CXCR antagonist AMG487. In addition, the effect
of CXCL10 on Sirt3 mediated macrophage polarization was elucidated through in
vitro experiments. The effect of M1 macrophage polarization on airway epithelial
cells was investigated by co-culturing with conditioned medium.
RESULTS: Clinical investigations showed that CXCL10 was highly expressed in
peripheral blood of children with asthma, and was associated with impaired lung
function (FEV1/FVC). Sirt3 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cell was
decreased. CXCL10 was found to the development of disease by promoting the M1
polarization of macrophages. Mechanistically, Sirt3 overexpression improved
CXCL10-induced macrophage polarization.
CONCLUSIONS: CXCL10 promotes M1 macrophage polarization by inhibiting Sirt3,
which plays an important role in the development of asthma.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 230,000-465,000 patients in Canada have severe asthma;
of these, 4-31% are uncontrolled. Despite increased availability of biologics,
many rely on oral corticosteroids (OCS) or short-acting β2-agonists (SABA),
which are associated with substantial short- and long-term adverse effects.
OBJECTIVE: ALERT aimed to characterize the demographics of patients with severe
asthma and uncontrolled severe asthma with and/or without biologics in Canada
and describe OCS/SABA and biologic treatment patterns.
METHODS: ALERT was a retrospective descriptive study using longitudinal claims
data from IQVIA's private drug plan database and the Ontario drug benefits
database. Adult patients with an inferred asthma diagnosis were assessed and
selected using a rule-based inference algorithm and further classified as having
severe asthma, uncontrolled severe asthma and uncontrolled severe asthma without
biologics, based on eligibility criteria including inhaled therapies and OCS
use. Patients were assessed for OCS, SABA and biologic use in the 12-month
analysis period; regional variation was described.
RESULTS: Patients with severe asthma, uncontrolled severe asthma and
uncontrolled severe asthma without biologics had a mean of 2.7, 4.4 and 4.2 OCS
claims per patient/year, respectively. Of patients with uncontrolled severe
asthma, 8.3% had ≥10 OCS claims. Combined OCS/SABA overuse (≥2 OCS/≥3 SABA
claims in the study period) was recorded in 6.1% of patients with severe asthma.
Most patients with uncontrolled severe asthma (71.8%) had no biologic claims.
Regional disparities in OCS use were observed.
CONCLUSION: Optimization of asthma management through improved diagnosis,
patient education, earlier specialist referral and region-specific improvements
is needed to reduce OCS/SABA use and increase biologic uptake for eligible
patients.

BACKGROUND: Early childhood wheezing may indicate asthma risk, making assessment
of environmental triggers crucial. Recent research has identified potential
effects of laundry product chemicals on airway epithelial barriers.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between the chemical contents and usage
habits of household laundry products and pulmonary function in preschool
children with recurrent wheezing and the effect of using soap-based detergent
without additives on respiratory parameters measured by impulse oscillometry.
METHODS: This prospective case-control study enrolled 80 recently diagnosed
wheezy children (CW) and 80 healthy children (HC) between August 2023-February
2024. Laundry habits and product chemical ingredients were recorded. Respiratory
function was measured by impulse oscillometry (IOS), assessing airway resistance
(zR5, zR20, R5-20) and reactance (zX5, zX20, Fres, AX).
RESULTS: Softener use was higher in the CW group (p=0.011). Chemical analysis
revealed significantly higher frequency of sodium laurylsulphate (SLS), nonionic
active substances, cocoglicoside, methylsotilozlolinone,
butylphenylmethylpropional, linolol, coumarin, and oxygen-based bleaching agents
in detergents used by the CW group compared to HCs (p<0.05). Similarly, cationic
active substances, coumarin, linolol, and benzisotizolinone were more prevalent
in softeners used by CW families (p<0.05). The CW group exhibited higher
resistance values (zR5, zR20, R5-20, Fres, AX) and lower zX5 compared to HC
(p<0.05). Children using additive-free detergents showed lower airway resistance
(zR5, zR20) (p<0.05), while those using soap-free products had higher resistance
measurements (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Wheezy children have greater exposure to laundry softener chemicals
than healthy counterparts. Additive-containing products were associated with
increased airway resistance, while soap-based detergents showed no detectable
impact on respiratory function. These findings suggest a potential link between
chemical laundry products and impaired respiratory function in preschool wheezy

BACKGROUND: The Global Lung Initiative (GLI) recently developed a race-neutral
reference equation in 2022 (GLI-2022); however, the implications of its use in
children with asthma, especially Latino children, have not been extensively
studied.
OBJECTIVE: Assess the difference in spirometry results, asthma severity and
airways obstruction classification for African American (AA), Latino and White
children with asthma after implementing GLI-2022.
METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study evaluated the first spirometry
performed by children with asthma aged 5-17 years between 01/01/2018 and
12/31/2023. Z-scores and percent predicted (pp) values for forced vital capacity
(FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and FEV1 /FVC were
calculated using GLI-2022 and race-adjusted Global Lung Function Initiative 2012
(GLI-2012) equations.
RESULTS: A total of 7138 children: 3543 AA, 2795 White, and 800 Latino were
included (median age = 10.3 years). FEV1 z-score median difference was -0.872,
-0.360, and +0.267 in AA, Latino, and White children, respectively (p < 0.0001)
after implementing GLI-2022. FVC z-scores, ppFEV1 and ppFVC values showed
similar patterns. Adopting GLI-2022 worsened asthma severity (based on ppFEV1)
and degree of airways obstruction (based on FEV1 z-score) classifications in AA
children, improved them in White children, and did not affect Latino children.
CONCLUSION: Implementing GLI-2022 impacted asthma severity and airway
obstruction classifications and resulted in a lower FVC and FEV1 in AA and
Latino children and greater values in White children. Using GLI-2022 may uncover
more cases of underdiagnosed asthma in AA and Latino children, which may
contribute to alleviating disparate asthma outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The long-term impact of asthma on mortality remains uncertain. This
study aimed to assess mortality and its predictors over 26 years in asthmatic
participants compared to those with or without other respiratory symptoms.
METHODS: This longitudinal cohort study included participants recruited from the
general Swedish population, followed from 1990 to 2016. The younger (30-39
years, n = 938) and older (60-69 years, at baseline, n = 1020) groups were
divided into asthma, other and no respiratory symptoms. Baseline data included
spirometry, allergy testing, smoking status, and quality of life. Survival
analyses were conducted using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: At 26-years follow-up the survival rates were 34 % and 95 % for
asthmatics in the older and younger age groups, respectively. Asthma was not
found to be a statistically significant independent predictor of mortality when
compared to non-asthmatics in either age group (older group HR 95 % CI: 0.94
(0.77-1.15); younger group: 1.39 (0.63-3.09). Significant mortality predictors
included increasing age ((1.13 (1.10-1.16)), male sex (1.73 (1.44-2.07), smoking
(2.01 (1.65-2.44), lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (0.67
(0.60-0.76), and more symptoms (1.21 (1.01-1.45) in the older group, while age
(1.14 (1.02-1.27) and other respiratory symptoms (2.44 (1.18-5.03) were
predictors in the younger group. Risk factors significantly linked to mortality
among older asthmatics included older age, male sex and current passive smoking,
and only male sex in younger asthmatics.
CONCLUSION: Asthma was not a strong independent predictor of mortality in either
age group, whereas age, male sex, other respiratory symptoms, smoking, and lower
FEV1, but not quality of life, were key risk factors. These findings highlight
the importance of identifying high-risk individuals and addressing modifiable
lifestyle factors such as smoking in mortality prevention strategies.

BACKGROUND: A raised blood eosinophil count (≥300 cells per μL), a marker of
type 2 inflammation, can identify patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) with higher exacerbation risk. Dupilumab reduced exacerbations in
patients with COPD and type 2 inflammation in the BOREAS trial. In this post-hoc
analysis, we evaluated the predictive value and longitudinal changes in type 2
inflammatory biomarkers in patients with COPD and type 2 inflammation from the
BOREAS trial who received dupilumab treatment.
METHODS: BOREAS, a phase 3, multicentre, double-blind, randomised trial was
conducted at 275 sites in 24 countries and included patients with COPD and type
2 inflammation (screening blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per μL). Patients were
randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 300 mg of dupilumab every 2 weeks for 52
weeks or matching placebo. Randomisation was stratified by country and inhaled
corticosteroid dose at baseline. This post-hoc analysis assessed blood
eosinophil counts, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), serum eotaxin-3,
total plasma immunoglobulin E (IgE), and serum pulmonary and
activation-regulated chemokine (PARC) concentrations in the safety population.
The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03930732 and is complete.
FINDINGS: BOREAS was conducted between April 15, 2019, and May 2, 2023, and
included 939 patients with COPD and type 2 inflammation. 468 patients were
randomly assigned to receive 300 mg of dupilumab every 2 weeks for 52 weeks and
471 were randomly assigned to receive matching placebo. 319 (34%) participants
were female and 620 (66%) were male. 657 (70%) were former smokers and 282 (30%)
were current smokers. At week 52, greater median percentage reductions were
observed in dupilumab versus placebo for most biomarkers (total IgE: -22·5% [IQR
-30·4 to -16·5] vs -0·9% [-6·5 to 4·8]; FeNO: -28·6% [-57·1 to 0] vs -6·9%
[-35·7 to 25·0]; eotaxin-3: -8·8% [-15·6 to -2·9] vs -0·4% [-5·6 to 5·0]; and
PARC: -14·4% [-29·2 to 2·1] vs -0·8% [-13·9 to 17·2]). Reductions were similar
across treatment groups by blood eosinophil counts. Exacerbation risk overall
was reduced, with a greater magnitude of reduction in those with higher baseline
blood eosinophil count (p=0·0056) and baseline FeNO (p=0·043).
INTERPRETATION: Patients with COPD and type 2 inflammation who were given
dupilumab showed reduced type 2 inflammatory biomarkers, with elevated blood
eosinophil count and FeNO predicting greater treatment response. These findings
support biomarker-driven treatment strategies to optimise therapy.

BACKGROUND: Asthma exacerbation is a cause of morbidity and mortality in the
pediatric population. In guidelines there is no consensus regarding discharge
criteria post exacerbation. Moreover, sleep has a known impact on gas exchange,
which might be clinically relevant in patients with obstructive lung disease.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the nocturnal oximetry
profile in hospitalized children with asthma exacerbation, pre-discharge.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nocturnal oximetry recordings of children with asthma
admitted in Aghia Sofia Children's Hospital between December 2020 and April 2024
were reviewed. In this cross-sectional study we compared them with recordings of
children with Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) and controls. Night-time basal
SpO2, Oxygen Desaturation Index3 (ODI3), as well as % of time spent <95 % were
compared. The Kruskal-Wallis test was employed to evaluate heterogeneity,
followed by Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test for pairwise comparisons between the
RESULTS: Asthmatic patients (n = 13) had lower basal SpO2 in comparison with
control (n = 21) and SDB group (N = 37) (SpO2 93.7 % versus 96.4 % and 96.7 %
respectively, p < 0.0001). They spent more time in SpO2< 95 % and had similar
ODI3 with the two other groups (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001 for asthma versus SDB
and asthma versus control group respectively). Moreover, in patients with asthma
a higher spot SpO2 was documented during the day, versus night-time basal SpO2.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights that clinical improvement precedes SpO2
improvement in asthmatic patients. A clinical review 48 h post-discharge is
advisable. Nocturnal basal SpO2 is lower than daytime spot SpO2, which should be
taken under consideration in implementation of guidelines.

INTRODUCTION: Communities disproportionately burdened by adverse
neighborhood-level social and structural factors may experience greater
vulnerability to environmental exposures, contributing to health inequities,
including adverse COVID-19. We assessed the effects of chronic air pollution on
COVID-19 morbidities in NYC and examined whether these effects varied by
neighborhood-level vulnerability.
METHODS: We used NYC COVID-19 hospitalization records (3/1/2020-2/28/2021) and
conducted analyses in the full sample and within hospital catchment. Chronic air
pollution (particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), black carbon
(BC), ozone (O3)) was assigned using residential ZIP Code (NYC Community Air
Survey; 2009-2019). Modified Poisson regression estimated risk of acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, ventilation, and dialysis, and
Cox regression estimated risk of discharge, adjusting for age, sex, BMI,
smoking, asthma, diabetes, and hypertension. We assessed effect modification by
neighborhood-level environmental vulnerability index (NEVI) tertiles.
RESULTS: From March to June 2020 (within hospital catchment), adjusted estimates
generally suggest greater chronic NO2, PM2.5, and BC was associated with
increased risk of ARDS, pneumonia, and dialysis, and not associated with
discharge and ventilation; inverse estimates found for chronic O3. Relationships
between air pollution and adverse COVID-19 were generally stronger among those
with greater neighborhood environmental vulnerability. For example, chronic NO2
and pneumonia's relationship was stronger in individuals within higher NEVI
tertiles (T1: aRR: 1.13, 95%CI: 1.02-1.25; T2: aRR: 2.11, 95%CI: 1.73-2.56; T3:
aRR: 6.36, 95%CI: 4.71-8.60).
DISCUSSION: Differences in neighborhood-level social and structural factors
contribute to unequal health burdens associated with air pollution. Public
health resources targeted toward neighborhoods with greater environmental
vulnerability can encourage population-level pandemic preparedness.

Various synthetic modifications of the alkaloid (-)-vasicinone are known to
exhibit a remarkable bronchodilatory effect. This study aimed to examine
selected pharmacological and toxicological properties of 2 quinazolines derived
from vasicinone with previously proven bronchodilatory action to consider their
potential applicability for further preclinical development. Both compounds were
found to have relatively low in vitro toxicity in a standard hepatic cell model.
Pharmacokinetic studies in rats using oral and intravenous administration showed
significant differences in oral availability (0.66 ± 0.11% vs 0.36 ± 0.18%),
distribution volume, and elimination parameters of the 2 tested agents (for all
parameters, P < .05). The different pharmacokinetic properties offer the
possibility to select more convenient compounds for inhalation or systemic
administration in further stages of development. The performed pharmacodynamic
studies using an in vitro model showed that the tested quinazolines bind to the
allosteric site on muscarinic acetylcholine receptors with micromolar affinity
(pKB higher than pKI for M1 and M3 receptors, P < .05) and exert functional
antagonism of carbachol-induced response. The main effect is not accompanied by
a concomitant antibiotic effect. The proven inhibition of muscarinic receptors
including the M3 subtype is analogous to the effects of clinically used
anticholinergic bronchodilators. Therefore, the findings suggest that the
bronchodilating effect of the tested compounds is likely mediated by a similar
mechanism. The muscarinic receptor blocking effect based on allosteric binding
to the receptors may potentially allow the development of a new group of highly
selective M3 antagonists. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Two tested synthetic
quinazoline derivatives with proven bronchodilator action exhibit allosteric
binding to muscarinic receptors. Since the extracellular domain at which
allosteric modulators commonly bind varies among subtypes of muscarinic
receptors, this characteristic may allow further development of highly selective
M3 antagonists. The examined compounds exhibit low toxicity as well as no
concomitant antimicrobial effect that would potentially affect the bronchial
microbiome.

BACKGROUND: Eotaxins (EOTs), primarily expressed in airway epithelial cells
(AECs), act as chemoattractants for eosinophils in asthma pathogenesis. Recent
studies have suggested that EOTs have additional functions beyond chemotaxis.
However, the distinct roles of EOTs remain incompletely understood.
METHODS: Serum EOT1, EOT2, myeloperoxidase (MPO), matrix metalloproteinase-9
(MMP-9), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) levels were
evaluated by ELISA and serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) levels were
measured by ImmunoCAP in 79 adult asthmatics. Clinical characteristics were
analyzed by inflammatory phenotype, disease severity, and serum EOT1/EOT2
levels. The functions of EOTs were investigated in vitro and ex vivo. For in
vivo, EOT1 and EOT2 were intranasally administered to
ovalbumin/lipopolysaccharide-induced asthmatic mice (BALB/c). To assess
neutralization effects, anti-EOT1 or anti-EOT2 antibodies were intranasally
administered.
RESULTS: Serum EOT1 and EOT2 levels were higher in patients with severe asthma
(SA) than in those with non-SA. Serum EOT1 levels were associated with increased
blood/sputum eosinophil counts and serum ECP levels, but not significantly
correlated with FEV1 (%) values. In contrast, serum EOT2 levels are correlated
with higher serum MPO, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 levels but lower FEV1 (%). In asthmatic
mice, EOT1 increased eosinophil counts and IL-5 production, whereas EOT2 induced
CXCL1 and MMP-9 production, junctional dysfunction and epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition in the lungs, which were attenuated by neutralizing EOTs using each
antibody.
CONCLUSION: EOT1 promotes T2/eosinophilic inflammation, whereas EOT2 accelerates
airway remodeling and lung function decline by activating neutrophils, providing
a new insight into the distinct roles of EOTs in the pathogenesis of SA.

BACKGROUND: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a common, chronic, and debilitating
inflammatory disease that most commonly affects intertriginous skin. Despite its
high heritability, the genetic underpinnings of HS remain poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic signals associated with HS, determine genetic
relationships with other diseases, and investigate potential molecular genetic
mechanisms.
METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of six
studies, totaling 4,540 cases and over 1 million controls and identified genetic
correlations with other common diseases. We integrated the HS data with
expression quantitative trait loci from 10 trait-relevant tissues, epigenomic
and transcriptomic data from human scalp, differential expression data from HS
lesions versus adjacent skin, and mesenchymal Hi-C chromatin looping data. To
identify functional noncoding variants, we performed transcriptional reporter
assays for signals near KLF5 and SOX9.
RESULTS: We identified eleven significant HS signals across seven loci: four
corresponded to previously reported associations, four represented novel signals
within known loci, and three were signals in newly implicated loci. We
identified significant genetic correlation between HS and other inflammatory
conditions, particularly inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, type
2 diabetes, and asthma. We prioritized candidate genes for the 11 signals. The
risk allele at KLF5 exhibited 10-fold greater transcriptional activity than the
non-risk allele, while risk alleles at SOX9 showed significantly reduced
transcriptional activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide insights into potential genetic mechanisms
underlying HS and suggest potential therapeutic targets for this challenging
condition.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Asthma is characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness
(AHR), allergic inflammation, and airway remodelling. Although recent studies
have shown that asthma pathophysiology involves P2X4 receptor activation, a
potential link with chronic asthma remains to be explored. We investigated the
effect of a novel P2X4 receptor antagonist BR11595 on allergen-induced airway
responses in a guinea pig model of chronic asthma.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Sensitized guinea pigs were exposed to saline or
ovalbumin (OVA) once weekly via aerosolization for 12 weeks. BR11595
(10 mg·kg-1) was injected intraperitoneally five times per week, for four
different regimens: all 12 weeks, first 6 weeks, last 6 weeks, or last week
only. Airway responsiveness to histamine was assessed 24 h before and 6 h after
OVA exposure in weeks 1, 6, and 12. Lung tissue inflammation and remodelling
were determined 24 h after the last OVA exposure.
KEY RESULTS: OVA induced AHR at weeks 1, 6, and 12 compared with
saline-challenged animals. The AHR was less pronounced in week 12 compared with
week 1. BR11595 significantly reduced OVA-induced AHR in week 6 in guinea pigs
treated with BR11595 for 6 weeks. AHR in week 12 was reduced after BR11595
treatment in week 12 only, next to OVA-induced eosinophilia and Goblet cell
hyperplasia, indicating an acute role of P2X4 receptors on chronic inflammation.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The P2X4-receptor antagonist BR11595 acutely
inhibits AHR, eosinophilia, and Goblet cell hyperplasia after 12 weeks,
indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for acute intervention of
chronic asthma attacks or exacerbations.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to substantial health
and financial burdens worldwide, and vaccines provide hope for reducing the
burden of this pandemic. However, vaccinated people remain at risk for
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) may identify
potential genetic factors involved in the development of COVID-19 breakthrough
infections (BIs); however, very few or no GWASs have been conducted for COVID-19
BI thus far. We conducted a GWAS and detailed bioinformatics analysis on
COVID-19 BIs in a European population via the UK Biobank (UKBB). We conducted a
series of analyses at different levels, including SNP-based, gene-based,
pathway, and transcriptome-wide association analyses, to investigate genetic
factors associated with COVID-19 BIs and hospitalized infections. The polygenic
risk score (PRS) and Hoeffding's test were performed to reveal the genetic
relationships between BIs and other medical conditions. Two independent loci
(LD-clumped at r2 = 0.01) reached genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10-8),
including rs36170929, which mapped to LOC102725191/VWDE, and rs28645263, which
mapped to RETREG1. A pathway enrichment analysis highlighted pathways such as
viral myocarditis, Rho-selective guanine exchange factor AKAP13 signaling, and
lipid metabolism. The PRS analyses revealed significant genetic overlap between
COVID-19 BIs and heart failure and between HbA1c and type 1 diabetes. Genetic
dependence was also observed between COVID-19 BIs and asthma, lung
abnormalities, schizophrenia, and type 1 diabetes on the basis of Hoeffding's
test. This GWAS revealed two significant loci that may be associated with
COVID-19 BIs and a number of genes and pathways that may be involved in BIs.
Genetic overlap with other diseases was identified. Further studies are
warranted to replicate these findings and elucidate the mechanisms involved.

Asthma is a chronic and heterogeneous inflammatory airway disease with diverse
clinical endotypes and limited curative treatment options. Recent systems
biology analyses identified four potential molecular triggers-AKT1, MAPK13,
STAT1, and TLR4-as candidate regulators of asthma-associated signaling pathways.
This study aimed to validate the expression of these four proteins and their
downstream signaling elements in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from
patients with allergic asthma (AA), nonallergic asthma (NA), and healthy
controls (HC), to explore their potential as biomarkers or therapeutic targets.
For that, PBMC samples were collected from 45 AA patients, 17 NA patients, and
15 HC subjects. Gene and protein expression of AKT1, MAPK13, STAT1, and TLR4
were quantified using RT-qPCR and Western blotting. Expression patterns were
compared across groups and stratified by asthma severity. Correlations with
clinical parameters (FEV1, FVC, FeNO, IgE, eosinophil counts) and treatment
regimens were also assessed. All four target genes showed significantly reduced
expression in asthma patients compared to controls (p < 0.001), with the most
marked downregulation in NA patients. At the protein level, MAPK13 and TLR4
showed significant differential expression. Stratification by severity revealed
a stepwise reduction in gene expression in AA patients, correlating with disease
severity, whereas NA patients showed uniformly low expression regardless of
severity. Multiple pathway-related genes, including RELA, SMAD3, NFATC1, and
ALOX5, were also downregulated, particularly in NA patients. Notably,
differential correlations were observed between gene expression and lung
function parameters in AA vs. NA groups. In conclusion, this study supports the
potential involvement of AKT1, MAPK13, STAT1, and TLR4 in asthma pathogenesis
and highlights differences between allergic and nonallergic asthma at the
molecular level. These proteins and their associated pathways may serve as
future targets for biomarker development or endotype-specific therapies. Further
studies in larger and more diverse cohorts, including functional validation, are
warranted.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory respiratory disease well-known to demonstrate
sexual dimorphism in incidence and severity, although the mechanisms causing
these differences remain incompletely understood. RPS4X and RPS4Y1 are X and
Y-chromosome-linked genes coding ribosomal subunits previously associated with
inflammation, airway remodelling and asthma medication efficacy. Particularly,
RPS4Y1 has been under-investigated within the context of disease, with little
examination of molecular mechanisms and pathways regulated by this gene. The
ribosome, a vital cellular machinery, facilitates the translation of mRNA into
peptides and then proteins. Imbalance or dysfunction in ribosomal components may
lead to malfunctioning proteins. Using CRISPR-Cas9 knockout cellular models for
RPS4Y1 and RPS4X, we characterised the function of RPS4Y1 in the context of the
asthma-relevant processes, inflammation and fibrosis. No viable RPS4X knockouts
could be generated. We highlight novel molecular mechanisms such as specific
translation of IL6 and tenascin-C mRNA by RPS4Y1 containing ribosomes.
Furthermore, an RPS4Y1-centric gene signature correlates with clinical lung
function measurements, specifically in adult male asthma patients. These
findings inform the current understanding of sex differences in asthma, as
females do not produce the RPS4Y1 protein. Therefore, the pathologically
relevant functions of RPS4Y1 may contribute to the complex sexually dimorphic
pattern of asthma susceptibility and progression.

Allergic diseases have been increasing in prevalence over the last years. In a
polluted environment, this problem can worsen and become more complex. Long-term
exposure to air pollution can lead to the aggravation of allergic rhinitis (AR)
and even to the development of seasonal asthma. Climate changes can accelerate
and extend the pollination season. Research indicates that air pollution may
modify the properties of pollen, making it more aggressive. Asymptomatic
allergic people disclose their allergies in a polluted environment. A polluted
environment complicates the diagnosis of seasonal allergies. The treatment might
be more challenging as standard allergy medications may not be enough to control
symptoms. The causal treatment of allergic rhinitis is specific allergen
immunotherapy (AIT), which may prove less effective in people living in a
polluted environment. The problem may lie in the proper evaluation for AIT as
well as the assessment of its effectiveness. To date, the best way to confirm an
allergy and qualify a patient for AIT seems to be molecular diagnostics. The
question arises whether patients exposed to air pollution, which could
potentially reduce the effectiveness of AIT, are still eligible for AIT. It is
also debatable whether molecular diagnostics remain effective in such cases.
Advancing precision medicine alongside environmental management represents a
critical pathway toward reducing the growing global burden of allergic diseases.

Asthma is a highly heterogeneous respiratory disease that, in its severe forms,
is characterized by persistent symptoms, frequent exacerbations, and a
significant impact on patients' quality of life. Despite high-dose inhaled
corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators, a subset of patients remains
uncontrolled, necessitating advanced therapeutic strategies. The advent of
biologic therapies has revolutionized the management of severe asthma, offering
targeted interventions based on the underlying inflammatory endotypes, primarily
T2-high and T2-low. However, selecting the most appropriate biologic remains
challenging due to overlapping phenotypic features and the limited availability
of validated biomarkers. This narrative review explores the clinical utility of
key biomarkers, including blood eosinophils, fractional exhaled nitric oxide
(FeNO), periostin, and total and specific IgE, in guiding biologic therapy. All
the information provided is based on an extensive literature search conducted on
PubMed. We also examine the clinical characteristics and comorbidities that
influence therapeutic choices. Furthermore, we present a practical
decision-making platform, including a clinical table matching phenotypes with
biologic agents, such as omalizumab, mepolizumab, benralizumab, dupilumab, and
tezepelumab. By integrating biomarker analysis with clinical assessment, based
on current guidelines and our extensive real-life experience, we aim to offer a
logical framework to help clinicians select the most suitable biologic treatment
for patients with uncontrolled severe asthma. Future research should focus on
identifying novel biomarkers, refining patient stratification, and evaluating
long-term outcomes to further advance precision medicine in the management of
severe asthma.

Background/Objectives: Pediatric asthma is a leading cause of emergency
department visits, and air pollution is a known primary environmental trigger.
Although worldwide air pollutants have been associated with asthma
exacerbations, limited data have been reported in the Eastern Province of Saudi
Arabia. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between air pollution
and pediatric asthma admissions among children aged 2 to 14 years old at King
Fahd Hospital of the University Hospital (KFHU). Methods: This is a
retrospective cohort study, over 366 days, including 1750 pediatric
asthma-related ER visits and daily concentrations of air pollutants (PM2.5,
PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3) and meteorological factors (temperature and
humidity). Various statistical models, such as Poisson regression and ARIMA,
were applied to determine the association between pollutants levels and hospital
ER visits. The data were visit-based in nature, and it was not possible to
follow up with repeat visits or for admission status for individual patients.
Results: Elevated levels of PM2.5, NO2, and CO were significantly associated
with more pediatric asthma ER visits, mainly on the same day and with short
lags. PM2.5 displayed the strongest association, consistent with its deeper
pulmonary penetration and greater toxicity. Also, PM10 levels were inversely
associated with ER visits, possibly due to particle size and deposition location
differences. Significantly correlated with increased ER visits are lower ambient
temperature and higher humidity. Conclusions: This study offers strong evidence
on the relationship between air pollution and pediatric asthma events, in turn
highlighting the vital importance of air quality regulation, public health
policies, and clinical vigilance for environmental exposures.

Background: The management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has advanced
significantly with the introduction of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic
drugs (bDMARDs). Despite these therapeutic strides, RA prognosis remains
profoundly affected by comorbid conditions, particularly cardiovascular and
metabolic complications, which increase both morbidity and mortality. The role
of bDMARDs in modulating comorbidities remains underexplored, with limited
evidence on their effects across various non-RA conditions, such as respiratory,
diabetic, and hematologic disorders. This systematic review aimed to evaluate
the impact of bDMARDs on the progression and outcomes of comorbidities in RA
patients, providing insights to guide personalized treatment approaches.
Methods: This systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022345903) and
followed the PRISMA guidelines. Original research articles from PubMed and
Scopus, published up to 18 July 2024, were included. Studies assessing the
impact of bDMARDs on comorbidities in RA patients met the eligibility criteria.
Results: A total of thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. They were
published from inception until July 2024. The studied comorbidities included
pulmonary conditions (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and
interstitial lung disease) (n = 2); diabetes (n = 3); anemia (n = 3); and
malignancies (n = 3). The bDMARDs studied were tumor necrosis factor inhibitors
(TNFis) (n = 9); Rituximab (n = 5); Tocilizumab (n = 5); Abatacept (n = 5); and
Anakinra (n = 2). The most reported effects of bDMARDs on comorbidities were the
following: (i) an exacerbation of pulmonary comorbidities for Abatacept and
TNFis; (ii) patients switched to or initiated on Abatacept as their first
targeted disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (tDMARD) showed directionally
lower rates and costs of T2DM-related complications compared with patients
switching to or initiating other tDMARDs; (iii) there was no difference between
Abatacept and TNFis or Rituximab/Tocilizumab regarding diabetes treatment
switching or intensification; (iv) Anakinra significantly reduced the HbA1c%;
(v) decreased serum hepcidin levels and improvement in anemia were observed in
patients treated with TNFis or Tocilizumab; and (vi) no decrease in overall
survival time or the significant incident malignancy rate was noted in RA
patients. Conclusions: Overall, bDMARDs appear safe for use in RA patients with
comorbidities and may even provide specific benefits for conditions such as
anemia and diabetes. These findings suggest that clinicians could consider
tailoring biologic therapy based on each patient's comorbidity profile,
potentially enhancing both RA management and comorbidity outcomes. For instance,
selecting biologics such as Anakinra or Tocilizumab might be advantageous for RA
patients with concurrent diabetes or anemia, given their observed metabolic and
hematologic benefits. This personalized approach could improve the quality of
life and reduce healthcare costs by addressing RA and associated comorbidities
more effectively.

Background/Objectives: Vitamin D is known to decrease the risk of contracting
respiratory infections and developing exacerbations for children with asthma.
This research evaluates the alterations in serum vitamin D concentrations and
examines lung function in children with asthma, as indicated by clinical
symptoms and paraclinical results, after experiencing SARS-CoV-2 infection or
other acute respiratory infections. Material and Method: This retrospective
study included 145 children with asthma. For each patient, the following
variables were acquired: demographic data, serum vitamin D levels, GINA asthma
control levels, the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), pulmonary function
tests parameters, data related to allergies, and the presence of exacerbations.
Children were divided into two groups, according to the presence or absence of
SARS-CoV-2 infection or other acute respiratory infections. Variables were
statistically processed in SPSS. Results: In total, 93 children with asthma with
SARS-CoV-2 infection or other acute respiratory infections and 52 children with
asthma without SARS-CoV-2 infection or other acute respiratory infections were
included in the study. Median serum vitamin D values were statistically
significantly lower in children with a variable airflow limitation, compared to
children with normal values (p = 0.004), as well as for children with partially
controlled asthma, relative to children with well controlled asthma (p <
0.0005). Similarly, children with acute respiratory infections/COVID-19 disease
had lower median values of serum vitamin D, compared to children without acute
respiratory infections/COVID-19 disease (p < 0.0005). A decrease in serum
vitamin D value was statistically significantly associated with an increase in
FeNO value for children with asthma with COVID-19 disease (p = 0.027), as well
as for the entire study group (p < 0.0005). Conclusions: Children with asthma
who had acute respiratory infections, including COVID-19 disease, showed
considerably reduced serum vitamin D levels and were linked to more significant
airflow limitation, reduced asthma control and elevated airway inflammation,
suggesting its potential role in influencing asthma severity and infection

Background: Even with advanced management involving pharmacologic and
ventilatory strategies, respiratory dysfunction increases morbidity and reduces
the quality of life. This narrative review examines how craniofacial and
cervical manipulative interventions-including nasomaxillary skeletal expansion,
breathing re-education, and structural techniques-may holistically optimize
airway function by enhancing neurological and lymphatic dynamics, modulating
vagal tone, reducing pharyngeal collapsibility, and supporting immune regulation
across diverse clinical settings. Objectives: To explore manual techniques that
influence respiratory and autonomic function and to evaluate their reported
clinical efficacy and supporting evidence, particularly in the context of airway
disorders such as asthma and pneumonia. Methods: A narrative review of the
literature from PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted using search terms
related to airway function and osteopathic manipulative techniques (OMTs). The
inclusion criteria spanned 2010-2025 English-language peer-reviewed full-text
articles on airway function, OMT, and emergency airway maneuvers. Clinical
trials, observational studies, and reviews were included; non-peer-reviewed
content and animal studies (unless mechanistically relevant) were excluded.
Chapman's reflexes related to respiratory function were incorporated to
highlight somatic-visceral correlations. Key Findings: The techniques reviewed
included frontal lift, vomer manipulation, maxillary and zygomatic balancing,
and cervical adjustments. Thoracic OMT methods, such as diaphragm doming and
lymphatic pump techniques, were also addressed. Emergency techniques, such as
the BURP and Larson maneuvers, prone positioning, and high-frequency chest wall
oscillation, were presented as comparative strategies to OMTs for acute airway
management. Conclusions: Craniofacial and cervical manipulations can be a
promising adjunct for enhancing airway function. However, the current literature
displays heterogeneity and lack of large-scale randomized trials, which
emphasize the necessity for standardized research and the establishment of
clinical guidelines with the collected evidence.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Asthma is a prevalent chronic condition affecting
approximately 300 million people globally. Despite advancements in treatment
protocols, poor adherence to asthma medication remains a significant issue,
often leading to severe complications, especially in children. This study aimed
to identify factors influencing medication adherence among parents of children
with asthma, using constructs from the theory of planned behaviour to better
understand and improve adherence.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study employed a survey incorporating constructs
from the theory of planned behaviour, demographic variables, and other
adherence-related factors. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression
analyses were applied to explore the relationship between these factors and
adherence to asthma medications.
RESULTS: Out of 152 parents who visited the survey link, 150 were eligible. The
average age was 35.58 ± 9.913 years; most participants were married (82%) and
female (62.6%). Multivariate linear regression analysis of the parents' factor
showed parental attitude (β = 0.38, p < 0.001) and subjective norms (β = 0.34, p
< 0.002) were significantly associated with parents' intention to adhere to
asthma medications.
CONCLUSION: The study found that parental attitudes and subjective norms
significantly impact the intention to adhere to asthma medication. Improving
adherence is crucial for effective disease management, reducing healthcare
costs, and enhancing the quality of life for children and their families.
Interventions should focus on educating parents about the importance of
adherence and engaging more family members to positively influence adherence
through strengthened subjective norms.

The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in early-life development, influencing
various aspects of health and disease. Dysbiosis, an imbalance in the gut
microbiota, has been linked to multiple health conditions, including allergies,
asthma, and obesity. In early life, the gut microbiota plays a key role in the
development and maturation of the immune system. Probiotics, live microorganisms
that confer health benefits when administered in adequate amounts, have emerged
as a potential treatment approach for dysbiosis in early life. Dysbiosis can
alter the resistance to pathogens, promoting atopic diseases, food
sensitization, and infections such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).
Probiotics have been shown to modulate the composition and function of the gut
microbiota in the perinatal and infant periods. They can increase the abundance
of beneficial bacteria, such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, and reduce the
levels of potentially harmful bacteria. Not all probiotics are created equal.
The effects of probiotics can vary depending on the specific strain used.
Probiotics have also been investigated for their potential benefits in other
areas of infant health, such as reducing the risk of respiratory infections and
improving growth and development. This review aims to analyze the current data
in the literature and to evaluate the health benefits of probiotic
administration in early life. Several studies have investigated the use of
probiotics in preventing or treating allergic diseases, such as eczema and food
allergies. While some studies have shown promising results, more research is
needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of probiotics in early life.
In conclusion, using probiotics to prevent dysbiosis-related conditions may be
considered a method of 'programming' the individual for optimal health
maintenance.

Equine asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterised by neutrophilic
inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and impaired pulmonary function.
Obesity, increasingly prevalent among domestic horses, has been identified as a
potential risk factor for exacerbating inflammatory conditions. This study aimed
to explore whether obesity modifies neutrophil metabolism and inflammatory
responses in horses affected by asthma. Six asthmatic horses in clinical
remission were categorised into two groups: obese and non-obese, based on body
condition score. Serum levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and peripheral blood
neutrophil counts were significantly higher in obese horses, indicating a
heightened systemic inflammatory state. Neutrophils from obese horses displayed
a stronger oxidative burst following zymosan stimulation and elevated IL-1β gene
expression in response to lipopolysaccharide, suggesting a hyperinflammatory
phenotype. Metabolomic profiling of neutrophils identified 139 metabolites, with
notable differences in fatty acids, branched-chain amino acids, and
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates. Pathway enrichment analysis
revealed significant alterations in fatty acid biosynthesis, amino acid
metabolism, and glutathione-related pathways. Elevated levels of itaconate,
citraconic acid, and citrate in obese horses indicate profound metabolic
reprogramming within neutrophils. These results suggest that obesity promotes a
distinct neutrophil phenotype marked by increased metabolic activity and
heightened responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli. This altered profile may
contribute to the persistence or worsening of airway inflammation in asthmatic
horses. The findings underscore the importance of addressing obesity in the
clinical management of equine asthma and open avenues for further research into
metabolic-targeted therapies in veterinary medicine.

The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) among individuals with asthma is
rising, yet limited evidence exists on predictors of use in this clinical
population. Understanding factors associated with e-cigarette use may help
inform public health interventions. In this study, we analysed data from 2671
individuals aged 16 years and older with doctor-diagnosed asthma, drawn from the
2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021 waves of the Scottish Health Survey. Current
e-cigarette use was defined as self-reported use at the time of the survey. We
used multivariable logistic regression to examine factors associated with
current e-cigarette use among individuals with asthma, estimating adjusted odds
ratios (aORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and p values for age, sex,
education, socio-economic deprivation, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and
self-rated health. Overall, 193 participants (7.2%) reported current e-cigarette
use. Current smokers had significantly higher odds of using e-cigarettes
compared to never smokers (aOR: 38.9; 95% CI: 18.5-82.0; p < 0.001). Former
smokers also had increased odds of e-cigarette use relative to never smokers
(aOR: 32.0; 95% CI: 15.2-67.2; p < 0.001). Each one-category increase in age
group (spanning approximately 10 years) was associated with a 23% reduction in
the odds of current e-cigarette use (aOR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.69-0.86; p < 0.001).
Participants living in less deprived areas had 15% lower odds of current
e-cigarette use for each one-quintile increase in the Scottish Index of Multiple
Deprivation (aOR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74-0.97; p = 0.016). E-cigarette use was not
significantly associated with sex, educational level, alcohol consumption, or
self-rated health. These findings indicate that e-cigarette use among
individuals with asthma is more prevalent among younger participants, those
living in socioeconomically deprived areas, and those with a current or former
smoking history. Further longitudinal research is needed to explore usage
trajectories and respiratory health impacts in this clinical population.

INTRODUCTION: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing, heterogeneous skin
disease affecting 2%-7% of adults, with roughly 30% having moderate-to-severe
disease. AD symptoms, like intense itching and skin pain, carry a substantial
disease burden that negatively impacts patients' quality of life (QoL) and
psychosocial well-being. Lebrikizumab is a novel, high-affinity monoclonal
antibody that selectively binds to and neutralises interleukin-13 with high
potency. Three clinical trials with lebrikizumab (ADvocate 1 and 2; ADhere)
demonstrated significant clinical benefit in patients with AD, while the 3-year
long-term extension study of lebrikizumab (ADjoin) further demonstrated
long-term efficacy and safety in patients with AD. The ADTrust study will
evaluate patient well-being, their relationship with their skin, long-term
effectiveness, and safety of lebrikizumab, treatment satisfaction, and long-term
effect of lebrikizumab treatment on different aspects of patients' lives,
including itch, pain, sleep, fatigue, work impairment and overall QoL among
adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD in a real-world setting.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This non-interventional, prospective, observational,
real-world evidence study will involve approximately 150 sites across Europe and
approximately 1200 adults with moderate-to-severe AD treated with lebrikizumab
for 2 years. The primary endpoint is patient well-being assessed by the 5-item
WHO Well-Being Index (WHO-5) questionnaire. Key secondary endpoints include
clinical effectiveness (Eczema Area and Severity Index and Investigator's Global
Assessment Scale), disease symptomatology and control (Patient-Oriented Eczema
Measure, 24-hour peak pruritus, skin pain, fatigue and sleep quality Numerical
Rating Scale, and safety and tolerability. Other validated endpoints will
evaluate physician-reported and patient-reported QoL and treatment satisfaction
(Dermatology Life Quality Index, Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire-9),
patients' work productivity and impairment (Work Productivity and Activity
Impairment (WPAI)-AD) and disease control (AD Control Tool). Novel experimental
endpoints will also be evaluated with the aim to assess patients' relationship
with their skin (SkinLove questionnaire), disease control (intensity and
frequency of flares) and an Effectiveness Diary+© (a brief monthly survey on a
voluntary basis with the aim to assess the long-term impact of lebrikizumab on
three fundamental aspects of the patients' life: the well-being (WHO-5), the
itch intensity (24 hours peak pruritus) and the frequency and intensity of
flares). Statistical analyses will be descriptive and explorative and based on
observed cases. Missing data imputation may be used to handle missing data for
primary endpoints and secondary effectiveness endpoints.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study will be conducted according to the
protocol, which has ethics committee approval (Hamburg Ethic Committee in
Germany: 2024-101358-BO-ff), and all applicable laws and regulatory requirements
for each participating country. The results will be disseminated through

OBJECTIVE: Significant differences have been observed in the prevalence of
peanut allergy across different US racial and ethnic groups. We aimed to
characterize current patterns of infant peanut introduction across racial,
ethnic, and socioeconomic strata, and their clinical, behavioral and attitudinal
correlates.
METHODS: Surveys assessing parental knowledge, attitudes and infant feeding
behavior were administered to a US population-based sample of 3062
parents/caregivers of children aged 7-42 months. Complex survey-weighted test
statistics estimated differences across relevant racial/ethnic, household
income, and caregiver educational attainment strata.
RESULTS: Cumulative rates of peanut introduction in the first 11 months of age
were significantly higher among White, non-Hispanic caregivers (F=7.7; p<.001),
caregivers with higher annual household incomes (F=5.6; p<0.001) and caregivers
reporting higher educational attainment (F=2.5; p=0.002). Similar racial,
ethnic, and socioeconomic differences emerged regarding perceived safety of
peanut introduction during the first year, as well as the perceived
effectiveness of early dietary introduction for peanut allergy prevention.
Caregivers reporting lower household incomes and educational attainment were
less likely to think peanut introduction during the first year was safe or
effective in peanut allergy prevention than those reporting higher socioeconomic
status. Similarly, caregivers of non-Hispanic Black children, those with lower
incomes, and those with lower educational attainment were less likely to report
receiving timely guidance from their child's primary care provider regarding
peanut allergy prevention.
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the timing of peanut introduction may contribute to
observed racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in peanut allergy
prevalence. Equitable FA prevention guidance from providers could address these
disparities.

BACKGROUND: In the United States, Black patients with asthma experience higher
exacerbation rates compared with non-Black patients.
OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that might explain the exacerbation rate
association with race in a cohort of patients with severe asthma (SA).
METHODS: CHRONICLE was an observational study of US adults with SA treated by
allergists/immunologists or pulmonologists. The analysis population was patients
not receiving biologic treatment. Propensity score (PS) methods were used to
identify factors associated with Black race. Non-Black-non-Hispanic or Latino
patients (non-Black) were the control group. A generalized linear model (GLM)
assessed the association between Black race and exacerbation rate, adjusted for
the PS.
RESULTS: Between February 2018 and July 2022, 180 Black and 574 non-Black
patients were eligible for PS analysis. Socioeconomic status was the strongest
discriminator of race (C statistic of 0.75), followed by environment (0.65),
demographics (0.64), smoking status (0.55), and comorbidities (0.55). Before
adjusting for PS, the GLM showed a 1.28-fold higher exacerbation rate among
Black patients compared with non-Black patients (RR [rate ratio] 1.28, 95% CI
1.01, 1.62; P=0.039). In the PS-adjusted GLM, Black race was no longer
associated with exacerbation rate (RR: 0.87, 95% CI 0.56, 1.35; P=0.522).
Results were similar for asthma-related emergency department and hospitalization
rates.
CONCLUSION: Higher exacerbation rates in Black patients with SA may be explained
by factors associated with Black race, such as socioeconomic status. Addressing
socioeconomic disparities and social determinants of health may help reduce the
exacerbation risk difference observed between Black and non-Black patients with
SA.

PURPOSE: The NEWTON study aims to describe clinical characteristics and
evolution of asthma control of adult asthmatic patients treated with extrafine
beclometasone dipropionate and formoterol fumarate (BDP/FF) NEXThaler® 100/6 μg.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: NEWTON (NCT05168995) is a European multinational,
multicentre, observational, prospective cohort study that included adults with
uncontrolled or poorly controlled asthma, starting BDP/FF NEXThaler® 100/6 μg
treatment within 14 days of enrolment and with no use of extrafine formulations
in the previous 6 months. Improvement of asthma control, lung function, quality
of life (QoL), treatment adherence, and satisfaction with the device were
assessed after 3 and 6 months from the enrolment visit. In addition, safety
events were monitored.
RESULTS: 620 subjects were enrolled in the study. 423 completed the ACQ-5
questionnaire at enrolment and at least once during the following 6 months.
69.3% of patients were initiated on maintenance and reliever treatment. At
baseline, the median ACQ-5 score was 2.0. After 6 months the median ACQ-5 score
had decreased significantly to 0.6 (p<0.0001). Similarly, after 6 months 66.1%
of patients showed improved asthma control. The proportion of subjects with
poorly controlled asthma fell from 65.1% to 17.5%. These improvements were
consistent with the 3-month follow-up results and improved lung function, QoL,
treatment adherence and device satisfaction. No new safety concerns were
reported.
CONCLUSION: Results of the NEWTON study confirm the effectiveness and safety of
the extrafine fixed combination of BDP/FF NEXThaler® 100/6 μg in adults with
uncontrolled asthma in a real-world setting.

BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity (ie, co-existence of two or more health conditions)
is highly prevalent in patients with difficult-to-treat asthma. However, it
remains unclear how multimorbidity correlates with disease severity and adverse
health outcomes in these patients and which comorbidities are most important. We
aimed to address this knowledge gap by developing a patient-centred, clinically
descriptive multimorbidity score for difficult-to-treat asthma.
METHODS: We used data from the UK-based Wessex Asthma Cohort of Difficult Asthma
(WATCH; n=500, data collected between April 22, 2015, and April 1, 2020) to
develop the Multimorbidity in Difficult Asthma Score (MiDAS). Initially, we
created a modified Asthma Severity Scoring System (m-ASSESS) in WATCH. We then
conducted univariate association analysis to test the association between the 13
commonest comorbidities and m-ASSESS in WATCH and used a branch-and-bound
approach to select the most relevant comorbidities for inclusion in MiDAS. We
calculated MiDAS values for all patients with complete information in WATCH
(n=319) and assessed them for correlation with components of m-ASSESS,
proinflammatory biomarkers, and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)
score, a quality-of-life measure. We also assessed the association of MiDAS with
multiple clinical outcomes in four international cohorts: two from Australia
(n=236, data collected between June 14, 2014, and April 1, 2022; and n=140, Aug
6, 2012, to Oct 18, 2016), one from southeast Asia (n=151, March 21, 2017, to
Jan 16, 2024), and one from the USA (n=100, July 9, 2021, to Dec 14, 2023).
FINDINGS: We selected seven common comorbidities (ie, rhinitis,
gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, breathing pattern disorder, obesity,
bronchiectasis, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-exacerbated respiratory
disease, and obstructive sleep apnoea) for inclusion in MiDAS on the basis of
the branch-and-bound analysis and combined them using multivariate linear
regression to derive a MiDAS model associated with m-ASSESS in WATCH. The range
of MiDAS scores was 9·6-16·2. In WATCH members, mean MiDAS value was 11·97 (SD
1·21) and MiDAS was nominally correlated with m-ASSESS components of poor asthma
control (τ=0·31 [95% CI 0·24-0·38]) and exacerbations (τ=0·16 [0·08-0·24]).
MiDAS was also correlated with worse total SGRQ score (r=0·39 [95% 0·28-0·49],
p<0·0001) and with the proinflammatory plasma cytokines interleukin (IL)-4
(r=0·19 [95% CI 0·06-0·31], p=0·0036), IL-5 (r=0·35 [0·24-0·46], p<0·0001), and
leptin (r=0·29 [0·17-0·40], p<0·0001) in WATCH. MiDAS values across the four
international cohorts were similar to those of WATCH (UK cohort), with mean
values of 12·33 (SD 1·47) and 12·31 (1·37) in the Australian cohorts, 11·80
(1·20) in the USA cohort, and 11·55 (1·23) in the Singapore cohort. In these
cohorts, MiDAS correlated with worse asthma control, worse quality of life,
anxiety, depression, and increased inflammation.
INTERPRETATION: MiDAS highlights the co-occurrence of multimorbidity with the
worst outcomes in difficult-to-treat asthma. These findings strongly indicate
that an airway-centric approach is inadequate and that holistic and
multidisciplinary care is imperative. This clinical score could help clinicians
to identify patients most at risk from their multimorbidity.

25 years after publication of a clinical trial in The Lancet on the anti-IL-5
antibody mepolizumab in individuals with allergic asthma, evidence has
accumulated that the pathogenetic role of eosinophils is fundamentally different
between asthma phenotypes. In the allergen-driven form of asthma, often starting
in childhood or during adolescence (ie, early onset asthma), blood eosinophil
counts are variable, mainly dependent on allergen exposure, and play only a
minor role (as a so-called sidekick) in allergen-induced asthma symptoms. By
contrast, eosinophils are persistently elevated and are crucial drivers of the
disease in the intrinsic (eosinophilic) form of asthma, which typically starts
in adulthood (ie, adult-onset asthma). These data suggest that eosinophilia
should not be considered a treatable trait in people with chronic airway
diseases, but only a complement to an accurate clinical diagnosis. This evidence
has major implications for the diagnosis of asthma phenotypes and the treatment
of asthma (eg, choice of the right biologic).

BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma are involved in complex
interactions between Th1 and Th2 inflammatory pathways. House dust mite (HDM)
activates protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) to trigger inflammatory
responses, but current treatments often provide inadequate control.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effects of selective PAR2
inhibition on Th1 and Th2 responses in human nasal epithelial (HNE) cells and
murine models of AR and asthma.
METHODS: We examined the effects of selective PAR2 inhibition using primary HNE
cells and HDM-induced mouse models (PAR2-wild-type [PAR2-wt] and knockout
[PAR2-ko]). Analyses included inflammatory signaling pathways, cytokine
profiles, airway responses, histopathology, and transcriptomics.
RESULTS: In HNE cells, PAR2 inhibition suppressed Th2 (interleukin [IL]-33,
TSLP) and Th1 (TNF-α, IL-6) inflammatory cytokines while inhibiting calcium
mobilization and ERK/NF-κB signaling cascades. In PAR2-wt mice, treatment with
the PAR2 inhibitor reduced HDM-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE), airway
hyperresponsiveness, and allergic inflammation in both nasal and bronchial
tissues, matching the anti-inflammatory profile of PAR2-ko mice. Bulk RNA
sequencing confirmed comprehensive suppression of inflammatory gene expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Selective PAR2 inhibition effectively attenuates HDM-induced
allergic inflammation by modulation of Th1 and Th2 pathways in human airway
epithelium and murine models. We suggest that PAR2 can be a possible target for
AR and asthma.
