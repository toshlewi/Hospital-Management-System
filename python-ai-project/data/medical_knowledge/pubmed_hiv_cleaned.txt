INTRODUCTION: Talaromycosis is an opportunistic fungal disease caused by
Talaromyces marneffei (TM), a significant pathogen predominantly affecting
immunocompromised individuals, especially those with HIV infection. Although
traditionally regarded as an HIV-associated infection, increasing cases have
been reported among HIV-negative patients.
CASE PRESENTATION: This report details a case of a 36-year-old HIV-negative
woman infected with Talaromyces marneffei. The patient presented with bone
destruction and was diagnosed through metagenomic next-generation sequencing
(mNGS). Despite receiving antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and symptomatic
treatment, the infection remained uncontrolled, ultimately progressing to
multi-organ failure and resulting in death.
CONCLUSION: Bone damage due to Talaromyces marneffei infection is very uncommon
in HIV-negative patients. Thus, healthcare providers should be alert for
possible skeletal lesions linked to this infection. Early diagnosis and
appropriate antimicrobial treatment are vital for the patient's prognosis.

PURPOSE: Men who have sex with men are at high risk of Human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) infection and bear the highest burden of the disease in Tanzania.
Although pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has demonstrated high efficacy in the
prevention of HIV infection in clinical trials, challenges with retention
threaten its effectiveness. Therefore, we assessed the extent and predictors of
retention in PrEP care among men who have sex with men in Tanga, Tanzania.
METHODS: This study included 369 men who have sex with men who were recruited
using respondent-driven sampling. Baseline data were collected using structured
questionnaires that captured socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics.
The primary outcome was one-month retention in PrEP care. A statistical analysis
using modified Poisson regression was conducted to identify independent factors
associated with 1-month retention.
RESULTS: A total of 369 men (mean age, 24.7 (± 5.5 years)) participated in the
study. After one month, 87 participants (23.6%) were retained in PrEP care.
Independent factors associated with retention included assuming a receptive
position in anal sex (aPR 1.6, 95 CI: 1.0-2.6, p = 0.030), having initiated
sexual activity with anal, oral, or thigh sex (aPR 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2-3.8, p =
0.011), and having adequate social support (aPR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.0-2.6, p =
0.030).
CONCLUSION: Tailored interventions that improve social support and address the
varying needs of men who have sex with men with diverse sexual behavior patterns
are essential for improving retention and maximizing the effectiveness of PrEP
in HIV prevention. Practically, this highlights the need to strengthen
supportive environments within communities and healthcare systems to enhance
retention in PrEP, reduce HIV transmission, and advance progress toward ending
HIV as a public health threat by 2030.

BACKGROUND: In pregnant women, HIV infection warrants special attention due to
the high risk of complications during pregnancy and the increased likelihood of
fetal HIV exposure. Consequently, screening for HIV in pregnant women within the
community and identifying associated risk factors are essential.
OBJECTIVE: The study aims to investigate the prevalence of HIV infection and the
associated risk factors in pregnant women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study that utilized convenience
sampling and was conducted between 2018 and 2020 at 107 commune health stations,
8 district health centers, and the Obstetrics Department of Vinh Long Provincial
General Hospital.
RESULTS: A total of 18,034 pregnant women, with a median age of 28 years.
Fifty-one cases (0.3%) tested positive for HIV. The risk factors associated with
an increased likelihood of HIV infection included having multiple sexual
partners, drug addiction, smoking, and engaging in unprotected sex. In the
multivariate model, only multiple sexual partners, drug addiction and alcohol
consumption were independent factors that significantly increased the risk of
HIV infection among pregnant women.
CONCLUSION: The study among pregnant women indicated that the HIV exposure rate
within the community is below 1.0%. Unsafe sexual behaviors with multiple
partners were identified as the most significant risk factor for HIV exposure
among pregnant women.

Fudan University, Shanghai, China.
BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the prevalence of liver fibrosis and
identify the associated risk factors among people with HIV (PWH) and metabolic
dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).
METHODS: Abdominal ultrasonography and transient elastography were performed to
assess liver fibrosis and steatosis. Lean MASLD was defined as MASLD occurring
in PWH with a body mass index (BMI) < 24 kg/m2. A cutoff of liver stiffness
measurement ≥ 7.1 kPa was set for significant liver fibrosis. The prevalence,
correlation factors, and risk factors were evaluated.
RESULTS: Among 361 PWH, 250 (69.25%) had a BMI < 24 kg/m2, and 141 (39.06%) were
diagnosed with MASLD. The 141 PWH with MASLD were classified as 2 groups based
on BMI: 58 (41.13%) as lean MASLD and 83 (58.87%) as overweight MASLD.
Significant fibrosis was observed in 121 of the 361 PWH, including 75 of the 141
with MASLD, 28 of the 58 with lean MASLD, and 47 of the 83 with overweight
MASLD. Among PWH with MASLD, independent risk factors for significant liver
fibrosis included higher alanine aminotransferase levels and the presence of
type 2 diabetes. Among PWH with lean MASLD, independent risk factors for
significant liver fibrosis included elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels
and the administration of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant liver fibrosis is highly prevalent among PWH and MASLD.
Multiple risk factors are associated with significant liver fibrosis among PWH.
These findings underscore the importance of early identification and management
of liver fibrosis in PWH.

Attomolar Detection of HIV-1 with Label-Free RCA-rCRISPR on Smartphone.
Mohammad N, Steksova A, Tang Y, Huang L, Velayati A, Zhang S, Poonam AD,
Jamalzadegan S, Breen M, Jiang G, Wei Q.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV) remains a major global public health
challenge, having led to over 42.3 million deaths since its discovery in the
early 1980s. Despite progress in prevention and treatment, around 60% of people
with HIV (PWH) remain undiagnosed in resource-limited regions,
disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations and underserved communities
across the world. This illustrates the critical need for accessible, accurate,
and equipment-free diagnostic tools to enhance detection and thus provide
opportunities to curb its spread. Here, we developed a low-cost, robust, and
label-free rolling circle amplification (RCA)-rCRISPR diagnostic platform for
detecting HIV viral load with minimal instrumentation. Our strategy, combining
the integration of RNA-detecting RCA reaction with plasmid reporter-based
ratiometric CRISPR (rCRISPR), enables sensitive detection of unprocessed RNA
targets without the need for intensive sample pre-treatment. This label-free
RCA-rCRISPR diagnostic platform detected HIV RNA down to single-digit aM
sensitivity (~3000 copies/mL) from PWH-derived HIV samples ex vivo . Unlike
typical RCA, which requires sample fragmentations to break long RNA target
sequences, our design harnesses the triple functions of the phi29 DNA polymerase
(namely exonuclease activity, polymerization, and strand displacement), enabling
the detection of the entire HIV genome without pre-fragmentation. For
point-of-care (POC) applications, we constructed an all-in-one smartphone-based
minigel electrophoresis device to facilitate equipment-free HIV viral load
testing, making it accessible to resource-limited communities. Additionally, the
assay has demonstrated the ability for point mutation detection ( BRAF mutation
in canine urothelial carcinoma), showcasing the robustness of our strategy for
broad disease diagnostic applications.

The soluble HIV-1 Vpu protein interacts with calmodulin in a Ca (2+) -dependent
manner.
Ishola O, Islam MM, Hadadianpour E, Borbat PP, Georgieva ER.
The HIV-1-encoded membrane protein Vpu plays key roles in virus lifecycle. Our
lab recently revealed a soluble form of Vpu, and we strived to determine its
possible physiological function. Here, we provide solid experimental proof that
soluble Vpu interacts with Ca 2+ -bound calmodulin (Ca 2+ -CaM). A putative
CaM-binding motif in Vpu was predicted, but there was no experimental evidence
of the Vpu-CaM association. We applied double electron electron-resonance (DEER)
and protein spin labeling to detect the soluble Vpu-CaM complex. We found that
soluble full-length and truncated C-terminal region of Vpu directly interact
with Ca 2+ -CaM. DEER results from the spin-labeled double cysteine mutant
S39C/A103C of CaM showed that upon association with Vpu Ca 2+ -CaM adopts a more
closed conformation compared to those in the absence of Vpu. This restructuring
is in agreement with previously observed Ca 2+ -CaM association with cellular
and other HIV-1 proteins. Our results indicate that soluble Vpu and CaM form an
equimolar complex. DEER results from doubly spin-labeled at residues Q36C/I61C
in Vpu C-terminal region suggest that Vpu's helices 2 and 3 move away from each
other to facilitated CaM binding. These observations tell that under
physiological conditions the soluble Vpu-CaM complex may provide Vpu with a
trafficking pathway to membrane destination.

Current vaccine strategies to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs)
against HIV-1 generally propose complex, multi-boost immunization regimens. In
rhesus macaques, SHIV infection has been observed to rapidly drive the
development of some classes of bnAbs that share structural similarities with
those in humans. Here, we generated a knockin mouse model with B cells bearing
the unmutated common ancestor (UCA) of the V2 apex-targeted bnAb lineage,
V033-a. A single immunization of mice with a germline-targeting native-like
trimer was sufficient to recapitulate the ontogeny of the mature rhesus bnAb in
knockin mice-including rare, disfavored somatic mutations-leading to the
induction of antibodies that exhibited potent neutralization against both
autologous and heterologous tier 2 viruses. A boost with Env escape mutant
trimers further improved breadth and potency, and cryo-EM structure revealed the
structural basis for heterologous neutralization breadth. Non-human primate and
mouse models can thus combine with structure to serve as a platform for
identifying and confirming immunogens that streamline HIV-vaccination regimens.

Dolutegravir Developmental Toxicity is Mitigated by Magnesium and Folate in
Zebrafish Embryos.
Cabrera RM, Mohamed A, Minowa R, Neugebauer KA, Gorelick DA.
Integrase-strand-transfer inhibitors have transformed HIV therapy, yet the
widely prescribed drug dolutegravir (DTG) has been linked to developmental
toxicity and its teratogenic mechanism remains uncertain. Here we use zebrafish
to dissect DTG toxicity during early vertebrate development. DTG exposure from
2-4 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 24 hpf produced high mortality and abnormal
morphology; co-treatment with folic acid or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate partially
restored normal morphology, whereas calcium had no effect. Strikingly,
supplementation with magnesium (Mg) rescued DTG-exposed embryos almost as
effectively as folate, implicating magnesium availability in protection. In
competitive binding assays, Mg increased binding of folate to purified folate
receptor (FOLR1) by 30% in the presence of DTG. Maternal-zygotic zebrafish folr1
mutant embryos contained significantly less endogenous folate than wild-type
embryos yet displayed marked hypersensitivity to DTG that could not be mitigated
by folate supplementation. Together, these findings reveal a dual mechanism in
which DTG antagonizes FOLR1 while concurrently sequestering Mg. Excess Mg
converts DTG into a Mg-bound DTG complex that can no longer antagonize FOLR1,
thereby restoring normal development. Our work identifies magnesium status as a
modifiable determinant of DTG teratogenicity and provides a proof-of-concept
zebrafish model that could be adapted for rapid in vivo screening of integrase
inhibitors for developmental phenotypes.

Transmembrane glycoproteins of enveloped viruses are the targets of neutralizing
antibodies and essential vaccine antigens. mRNA-LNP technology allows in situ
production of transmembrane glycoproteins upon immunization, but biophysical
characterization of transmembrane antigens and in vitro analysis of
post-immunization antibody responses typically rely on soluble proteins. Here,
we present a methodological platform for assembling transmembrane glycoprotein
vaccine candidates into lipid nanodiscs. We demonstrate the utility of the
nanodiscs in HIV membrane proximal external region (MPER)-targeting vaccine
development by binding assays using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), ex vivo B
cell sorting with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and by determining
the structure of a prototypical HIV MPER-targeting immunogen nanodisc in complex
with three broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), including the MPER bnAb
10E8, to 3.5 Å by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), providing a template
for structure-based immunogen design for MPER. Overall, the platform offers a
tool for accelerating the development of next-generation viral vaccines.

HIV and Maternal-Fetal Immunity: Challenges and Strategies for Reducing Vertical
Transmission-A Narrative Review.
Obeagu EI(1).
(1)Department of Biomedical and Laboratory Science Africa University Mutare
Zimbabwe.
BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV remains a
significant global health challenge, particularly in resource-limited settings.
The virus disrupts maternal-fetal immunity through immune dysregulation,
placental barrier impairment, and altered antibody transfer, thereby increasing
the risk of vertical transmission.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on the
immunological and clinical factors influencing MTCT. It highlights how maternal
immune exhaustion, placental inflammation, and suboptimal ART timing contribute
to transmission. While widespread use of ART has reduced MTCT rates, persistent
challenges include late ART initiation, HIV drug resistance, co-infections, and
transmission through breastfeeding. Emerging strategies-such as maternal immune
modulation, monoclonal antibody therapies, and tailored ART regimens-show
potential for further risk reduction.
CONCLUSION: To effectively minimize MTCT, comprehensive prevention approaches
are essential. These should combine medical interventions with maternal
nutrition support, co-infection management, and safe breastfeeding practices
under ART coverage. A multifaceted strategy is key to protecting both maternal
and infant health.

Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) offer a promising route to protect
against rapidly evolving pathogens such as HIV, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2, yet
eliciting them through vaccination remains a significant challenge. A key to
this problem lies in understanding antibody affinity maturation (AM), the
evolutionary process within germinal centers (GCs) that shapes the B cell and
thus antibody response. Traditionally, AM has been viewed as favoring the
selection of B cells with the highest-affinity B cell receptors (BCRs) through
competitive interplays. However, emerging evidence suggests that GCs are more
permissive, allowing B cells with a broad range of affinities to persist,
thereby promoting clonal diversity and enabling the rare emergence of bnAbs.
This review reassesses affinity-based selection models and proposes a new
paradigm that integrates multifactorial processes, including stochastic B cell
decisions within GC dynamics, antigen extraction efficiency influenced by
probabilistic bond rupture, and avidity-driven BCR binding alterations and
representations on multivalent antigens. We highlight how advanced AM
simulations that move beyond affinity as the sole determinant provide a more
realistic and predictive representation of AM, marking a major step forward in
developing strategies to promote effective immune responses against highly
mutable, complex antigens.

Antiretroviral therapy can manage HIV infections, but a cure remains elusive
owing to viral latency. The "shock and kill" strategy uses latency-reversing
agents (LRAs) to reactivate viral production toward eliminating latent HIV.
However, developing novel LRA scaffolds remains a critical challenge. This study
focused on a structurally simplified hydrobenzopyran analogue of ansellone A, a
natural product with latency-reversing activity. To investigate the influence of
incorporating ether oxygen into the alkyl chain, thought to anchor to the
biological membrane, on the biological activity, we designed and synthesized a
series of hydrobenzopyran analogs with varying oxygen positions in their
lipophilic side chains. Biological evaluation in J-Lat 10.6 and TZM-bl cells
revealed that the oxygen atom position did not considerably influence the HIV
latency-reversing activity. Furthermore, none of the compounds affected cell
viability. These findings suggest that ether-containing hydrobenzopyran
derivatives represent a viable and synthetically flexible scaffold for the
development of novel LRAs.

Associations between ZIP code-level alcohol outlet density and binge drinking
among people who inject drugs in 22 US Metropolitan Areas.
Peddireddy SR, Beane S, Yarbrough C, Ibragimov U, Cummings JR, Haley DF, Linton
SL, Cooper HLF.
BACKGROUND: Although alcohol outlet density (AOD) is associated with drinking
behaviors in the general population, little evidence exists about this
relationship among people who inject drugs (PWID). Establishing this connection
is particularly important, as alcohol use exacerbates the risk of opioid
overdose. This study investigated 1) the association between ZIP code-level AOD
and binge drinking among PWID who use opioids, and 2) the potential moderating
effect of race/ethnicity on the AOD-binge drinking relationship.
METHODS: This analysis linked 2018 National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS)
data and 2016 ZIP code-level AOD data from the ZIP Code Business Pattern survey.
Hierarchical generalized linear models quantified the association between AOD
and binge drinking, overall and by race/ethnicity.
RESULTS: Of 9,660 PWID, 27% reported recent binge drinking. For Hispanic/Latinx
and White PWID, increases in AOD were associated with a 1% and 3% increase in
the odds of binge drinking, respectively (p < 0.05); AOD was unrelated to binge
drinking among Black PWID. However, when AOD was set to the median, binge
drinking probability was highest among Black PWID (PP: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.24-0.33).
CONCLUSIONS: Reducing AOD may decrease binge drinking among White and Latinx
PWID. Our results suggest, however, that this strategy alone may be not be
effective among Black PWID. Holistic strategies targeting structural
determinants of alcohol and opioid co-use among Black PWID are needed to address
inequities in drug-related harms.

ZIP code-level alcohol outlet density and nonfatal overdose among people who
inject drugs in 22 US metropolitan statistical areas: a multilevel modeling
analysis.
BACKGROUND: Alcohol outlet density (AOD) is associated with drinking behaviors
and related harms across several populations. As alcohol consumption compounds
the depressive effects of opioids to increase overdose risk among people who
inject drugs (PWID), this study investigated 1) whether off-premise AOD is
associated with the risk of nonfatal overdose among a large sample of PWID, and
2) whether this relationship varies by individual race/ethnicity.
METHODS: We linked individual-level 2018 National HIV Behavioral Surveillance
(NHBS) data with ZIP code-level data on off-premise AOD in 2016 from the US
Census Bureau's ZIP Code Business Pattern survey. NHBS surveys PWID across 22
metropolitan statistical areas. Hierarchical generalized linear models
quantified the association between AOD and nonfatal overdose, overall and by
PWID race/ethnicity.
RESULTS: The sample comprised 9,764 PWID who used opioids, 45% of whom were
non-Hispanic/Latinx White, 38% non-Hispanic/Latinx Black, and 18%
Hispanic/Latinx. Over a quarter (28%) experienced an overdose in the past year.
The median outlet density was 4.0 outlets per square mile. The adjusted model
did not show a significant relationship between AOD and odds of overdose (OR:
1.01, 95% CI: 1.00-1.02), and the relationship remained null in the
race/ethnicity interaction model.
CONCLUSIONS: Regulating AOD alone may not effectively mitigate overdose risk
among PWID. Future research should explore why overdoses among PWID are not
sensitive to changes in AOD. Possible explanations to consider are whether (1)
AOD is unassociated with alcohol consumption among PWID, or (2) PWID stagger the
timing of their alcohol consumption so it does not coincide with opioid
consumption.

Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is a rare genetic skin disorder
characterized by increased susceptibility to human papillomavirus infections
(HPV) and a high risk of cutaneous carcinomas. We report the case of a
30-year-old female patient presenting with diffuse verrucous lesions,
predominantly affecting the extremities, associated with unilateral
elephantiasis. The diagnosis was histologically confirmed, revealing vulgar
warts consistent with EV. HIV serology was negative, and systemic retinoid
therapy was initiated. EV is linked to mutations in the EVER1 and EVER2 genes,
predisposing patients to chronic infections with specific HPV types. Close
monitoring is crucial to prevent malignant transformation. This case highlights
the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of EV, emphasizing the importance of
an appropriate management strategy to control lesions and prevent complications.

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) is associated with significant
morbidity and mortality, but there is a paucity of data regarding these
infections in sub-Saharan Africa, especially among people living with HIV
(PLWH). This study investigated the impact of HIV on clinical presentation,
microbial aetiology, laboratory findings, and outcome of SCAP. This was
additional analysis of data from a large, single-centre, retrospective,
observational study conducted among consecutive adult patients (≥18 years)
admitted to the multidisciplinary ICU at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg
Academic Hospital, between 1 July 2007 and 31 May 2019, with SCAP. The current
study describes 718 PLWH and 131 HIV-negative cases extracted from the initial
cohort. The median age was 37 [IQR 30-46] years with PLWH significantly younger
than their HIV-negative counterparts (36 years [IQR 29-44] years vs 52 years
[IQR 34-65] years; P < .001). PLWH were more commonly female (P = .053), while
more of the HIV-negative patients were male. The median CD4 count of the PLWH
was 42 [IQR 14-108] cells/mm3 and only 15.5% were on anti-retroviral therapy
(ART) prior to hospitalisation. Differences were noted in clinical, laboratory
and radiological features between the groups. Overall, Mycobacterium
tuberculosis was the most common microbial aetiology in both groups, followed by
Streptococcus pneumoniae, which was associated with a significantly lower
mortality, whereas mortality with Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, which
occurred only in PLWH, was high. Overall ICU mortality was high (48.9%), and
while HIV was an independent risk factor for mortality (OR 0.58, 95% CI
0.37-0.92; p = .02) on univariate analysis, this finding was not true when HIV
considered within the multivariable analysis. This study describes one of the
largest cohorts of PLWH with SCAP and compares their findings with HIV-negative
cases. HIV was not a significant predictor of mortality when considered in the
context of other covariables on multivariable analysis.

ObjectiveAdverse drug reactions (ADRs) induce iatrogenic harm in antiretroviral
therapy (ART) care continuum. However, there is a dearth of concrete evidence in
a resource-limited setting. Thus, this study was designed to consolidate
existing knowledge, thereby informing policy and clinical care to improve
patient safety.DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.Data sourcesPubMed,
CINAHL, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases were searched.Eligibility
criteriaEmploying the condition, context, and population framework,
observational primary studies were included.Data extraction and
synthesisIndependent reviewers undertook data extraction and synthesis. This
meta-analysis employed the random-effects restricted maximum likelihood (REML)
method, with its protocol preregistered on the International Register of
Systematic Reviews (CRD42024546390).ResultsThe pooled prevalence of ADRs was
36.7% [95% CI: 26.6-46.9, I2 = 99.64%].ConclusionAltogether, this study revealed
that ART-related ADRs in Ethiopia was 36.7%, underscoring rigorous monitoring.
Giving special emphasis to patients with female gender, advanced disease,
comorbidities, malnutrition, TB treatment, and poor adherence is a prudent
decision.
Plain Language Summary: Epidemiology of ART-related Adverse Drug Reactions among
Patients with HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia: A Systematic Review and
Meta-analysisMedicines are crucial in the arena of the healthcare system.
Despite the undeniable relevance of medicines, a substantial challenge is the
potential for harmful drug reactions when used. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is
the application of antiretroviral medicines to combat human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV). While it is pivotal in treating diseases, it is plugged with
adverse drug reactions (ADRs). ADRs are harmful effects that can occur when
people take medications. These undesirable drug effects are quite common and
especially costly in the treatment of HIV. In countries with limited healthcare
resources, there is limited information about how common these harmful effects
are. This study aimed to bring together the available evidence about the rate of
ADRs related to ART among people living with HIV in Ethiopia. In this study, we
reviewed the results of 29 studies involving 19,003 people living with HIV. We
found that about 4 in every 10 patients (36.7%) experienced ADRs from their
treatment. Our analysis also showed that certain groups, including women, those
with lower education levels, advanced HIV disease, other chronic health
problems, weaker immune systems (low CD4 counts), opportunistic infections,
malnutrition, and those taking medications containing zidovudine or nevirapine,
were more likely to face these ADRs. Patients receiving tuberculosis treatment
at the same time or struggling with medication adherence were also at higher
risk. Based on these findings, special attention should be given to monitoring
these vulnerable groups to catch and manage ADRs early.

Studies focusing on individuals living with HIV and mental disorders are crucial
to inform and enhance care for this inherently vulnerable population group,
especially considering that people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) are more likely
to develop mental disorders compared to the general population, contributing to
lower adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). This study cross-sectional
study aimed to assess self-reported adherence to antiretroviral therapy among
PLHIV and moderate or severe mental disorders in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do
Sul, Brazil. Patient-reported data from PLHIV who received care in at least one
of the Psychosocial Care Network facilities of the Brazilian Unified Health
System from 2014 to 2018 were collected to assess the adherence to ART. Among
the 76 participants eligible, 35 were included in the study. Substance
use-related mental disorders were the most prevalent (45.7%), followed by mood
disorders (25.7%) and anxiety (11.4%). Most of the participants had a low ART
adherence (62.9%), followed by insufficient adherence (22.9%) and good adherence
(14.3%). No significant associations were found between the adherence to ART and
the study variables. Our findings suggest the importance of assessing adherence
based on both direct and indirect measures, as biological markers and
self-report.

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a distinct, chronic inflammatory skin disease
characterised by intensely pruritic, fibrotic nodular lesions. Despite continued
progress in the field, lack of clarity regarding the definition of PN as a
disease, clinical presentation and therapeutic options results in delayed
diagnosis and management. PN can arise following other diseases, but once
established, it is an independent disease. Here, we summarise the current
knowledge of epidemiology, clinical characteristics, disease burden and
management approaches that may help healthcare providers recognise PN as a
primary diagnosis independent of triggers or associated comorbidities. PN is
more common among patients aged 50-60 years, and some evidence suggests it is
more frequent among Black populations than White and Asian populations. A subset
of PN patients have an atopic background and can present with comorbid atopic
dermatitis; however, PN can also exist without atopic comorbidities. Other
comorbidities typically include diabetes, obesity, thyroid disease, kidney
disease, chronic liver disease, hypertension, HIV infection, skin infections,
malignancies and mental health disorders. Multiple intensely pruritic lesions
induce chronic scratching, which leads to inflammation, hyperkeratotic nodules
and perpetuation of a vicious itch-scratch cycle. PN is associated with a high
disease burden and negative effect on quality of life; patients often report
intense and relentless itching, poor sleep, absence from work, anxiety and
depression. Early diagnosis of PN and identification of comorbidities are
important to facilitate better disease management. By increasing their awareness
of PN epidemiology, disease burden, clinical presentation and management,
physicians may begin to identify the disease as a distinct condition independent
of its triggers or associated comorbidities and provide patients with
appropriate care earlier in their treatment journeys.

INTRODUCTION: According to global monitoring and UNAIDS estimates. In
Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, the number of pregnant women living with
HIV in 2020 was 1.2 million. A variety of studies revealed that people living
with HIV desire reproduction in the absence of any ART administered to the
mother; the rate of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV is 25-45%.
Transmission and most child deaths related to HIV can be avoided with
appropriate care during pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding. So far, there
is limited information on the incidence of pregnancy outcomes and their
predictors in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aims to determine pregnancy
incidence and associated factors among reproductive-age women living with
HIV/AIDS who are on ART clinic follow-up in public health facilities of the Arsi
Zone, central Ethiopia.
METHODS: An institution-based retrospective cohort study was employed among 481
reproductive-age women from December 2013 to April 2019 in ART clinics of
selected public health facilities in the Arsi Zone, Ethiopia. Systematic random
sampling was used to select study subjects from each public health facility.
Data were imported into Epidata version 3.2 and exported into Stata version 14.2
for analysis. The Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier failure models
were used to determine pregnancy predictors and estimate incidence,
respectively. Independent predictors of pregnancy were determined by looking at
variables that showed significant results (P value < 0.05) in the multivariate
RESULTS: The study included 481 women in total, yielding a response rate of
96.2%. The overall incidence of pregnancy was found to be 45.47 per 1000
person-years. Being 35 years of age or older (AHR: 0.29; 95% (0.13, 0.64)),
being in a non-married couple (AHR: 0.14; 95% (0.04, 0.48)), being widowed or
divorced (AHR: 0.20; 95% (0.05, 0.83)), and being a single mother (AHR: 0.42;
95% (0.19, 0.92)) were predictive factors of pregnancy incidence among women on
ART.
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: In this study, the incidence of pregnancy among
women on ART was found to be notable. Pregnancy incidence among women on ART was
found to be negatively associated with being 35 years of age or older, being in
a non-married couple, being widowed or divorced, and being a single mother. To
lower the risks of pregnancy, effective counseling programs must be created,
with an emphasis on young and married women living with HIVAIDS.

BACKGROUND: Besides the commonly used intravenous formulations of amphotericin
B, an oral nanocrystal amphotericin B (MAT2203) formulation is being evaluated
for efficacy to treat invasive fungal infections. This new experimental oral
formulation has not been used before.
METHODS: Herein, we describe our experiences with using oral amphotericin B for
management of patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis in Uganda
from a research nurse perspective.
RESULTS: We found oral amphotericin B a better alternative to intravenous
amphotericin B deoxycholate due to less toxicity, mostly limited to
gastrointestinal-related toxicities only. We clinically observed no drug
reactions like rigors, phlebitis, and less vomiting among patients on oral
amphotericin B as compared to those on intravenous amphotericin B deoxycholate.
Subjectively, meningitis symptoms of patients on oral amphotericin B seemed to
overall clinically improve more rapidly compared to those receiving intravenous
amphotericin B deoxycholate. Few adverse events were observed. A novel challenge
with oral amphotericin was difficulty in monitoring adherence for the night
doses in the absence of the healthcare providers.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral amphotericin B was generally safe and well tolerated. However,
it requires some training for the nurse, patient and care takers for better
administration, adherence and treatment outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: HIV/hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection elevates the risk of
liver-related complications compared to HIV or HBV mono-infections. While some
antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens slow liver disease progression, the
long-term effects of tenofovir-based and non-tenofovir-based ART on advanced
liver disease events in people with HIV/HBV remain unclear.
METHODS: People with HIV/HBV and aged ≥ 18 years or older who initiated ART
between April 2016 and January 2024 were included from the US HealthVerity
claims database. Advanced liver disease events (cirrhosis, liver decompensation,
hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], and liver transplant) were evaluated overall and
individually among people who received tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)-based,
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-based, or non-tenofovir-based ART; people
with events prior to ART initiation were excluded. The time to advanced liver
disease events were estimated with Kaplan-Meier methods. Adjusted hazard ratios
and 95% CIs were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. To evaluate
liver function over time, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate
aminotransferase levels before and after ART initiation were assessed for up to
1 year using adjusted mixed-effect models.
RESULTS: Among 3095 people included, 76% initiated TAF-based, 13% initiated
TDF-based, and 11% initiated non-tenofovir-based ART. TAF-based and TDF-based
ART had significantly longer times to any advanced liver disease event compared
to non-tenofovir-based ART (log-rank P < 0.01). After adjustment, both TAF-based
and TDF-based ART retained significantly reduced the risk of any advanced liver
disease event and TAF-based ART had a lower risk of cirrhosis and risk of HCC
compared with non-tenofovir-based ART (P < 0.05). Tenofovir-based ART was
associated with stable liver enzyme levels over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Tenofovir-based ART was associated with a reduced risk of severe
liver-related complications overall. TAF-based ART was associated with
progression to cirrhosis and HCC, relative to non-tenofovir-based ART in people
with HIV/HBV. These findings highlight the importance of tenofovir-based ART
regimens in improving outcomes for people with HIV/HBV.

INTRODUCTION: People with HIV are living longer, but frailty may increase
vulnerability to adverse drug interactions, particularly with sedative
medications.
AIM: To describe sedative co-medication patterns across frailty states using
network-based analysis, and to identify key medications driving interaction
complexity.
METHOD: This cross-sectional study analyzed 321 participants using sedatives
from the Positive Brain Health Now Cohort (mean age: 53 years), categorized as
robust (30.2%), prefrail (47.0%), or frail (22.7%). Sedative use was classified
using the Sedative Load Model, and frailty was assessed with a modified Fried
Frailty Phenotype. Co-medication networks were constructed for robust, prefrail,
and frail groups, with metrics such as Neighborhood Shift Scores (NESH) and
ΔBetweenness used to evaluate network dynamics. Edge-level Observed-to-Expected
ratios highlighted significant drug pairings and interaction risks.
RESULTS: Frail individuals exhibited the most interconnected sedative network
(graph density: 0.24; average degree: 7.31) followed by prefrail (graph density:
0.18; average degree: 6.67) and robust groups (graph density: 0.13; average
degree: 4.61). Medications with high network influence included mirtazapine
(robust-to-prefrail: NESH = 2.05; ΔBetweenness = 0.23), gabapentin
(robust-to-frail: NESH = 2.46, ΔBetweenness = 0.10), and pregabalin
(prefrail-to-frail: NESH = 2.55; ΔBetweenness = 0.71). High-risk sedative pairs
in frail individuals included hydromorphone-clonazepam (Observed-to-Expected
ratio: 3.07; interaction severity: D), amitriptyline-oxycodone
(Observed-to-Expected ratio: 1.92; severity: D), and quetiapine-citalopram
(Observed-to-Expected ratio: 2.12; severity: D). Prefrail individuals had
intermediate-risk combinations, including clobazam-levetiracetam
(Observed-to-Expected ratio: 81.5; severity: C), and gabapentin-hydroxyzine
(Observed-to-Expected ratio: 3.58; severity: D). Robust individuals showed fewer
and lower-risk patterns, such as amitriptyline-pregabalin (Observed-to-Expected
ratio: 4.00; severity: C). Network differences reflect increasing polypharmacy
and adverse interaction risks with advancing frailty.
CONCLUSION: Sedative co-medication patterns vary meaningfully across frailty
states in people with HIV. Frailty is associated with more complex networks and
a greater likelihood of high-risk drug interactions. Medications influencing
these patterns can help identify opportunities for safer prescribing. The
prefrail stage may offer a timely window for interventions aimed at minimizing
polypharmacy and improving safety in middle-aged and older adults with HIV.

This study explores HIV prevalence and its social determinants in the
southernmost state in Brazil, where the HIV epidemic has historically been more
severe. A population-based serological household survey was conducted in 56
sampled municipalities between 2020 and 2022. Adult residents completed
electronic questionnaires and provided blood samples for HIV testing, following
Brazilian guidelines. Statistical analysis employed survey-weighted methods and
hierarchical robust Poisson regression models to investigate factors associated
with HIV prevalence. Quality control measures and sensitivity analyses were
included to ensure result robustness. Among 7978 analyzed participants, 81 HIV
cases were serologically detected (51 also self-reported), resulting in an
estimated overall HIV prevalence of 0.99% (95% CI 0.56-1.75). A generalized HIV
epidemic was confirmed in the metropolitan health macro-region of Rio Grande do
Sul, where HIV prevalence was 1.64% (95% CI 1.59-1.70). Socioeconomic position
was the most important factor associated with HIV prevalence, even after
adjustments. Disparities in HIV distribution across regions and subpopulations,
combined with rising prevalence trends in other Brazilian states, support
implementing a national serology household survey to create evidence-based
policies addressing systemic social inequities. The high proportion of unknown
HIV cases highlights the need for improved community-based testing strategies.

OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to explore the acceptability of reducing the
frequency of asymptomatic Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae
(Ng) screening among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men
(GBMSM)(Although the term GBMSM is used for convenience, the study also includes
nonbinary people who were assigned male at birth who have sex with men.).
Additionally, it sought to identify barriers and facilitators to implementing
such changes and to develop potential interventions that could support a shift
in current screening guidelines.
METHODS: This qualitative study explored stakeholder perspectives on reducing
screening frequency and identified potential interventions that could support
future guideline changes of this kind. Semistructured interviews were conducted
with 22 GBMSM and 8 professional stakeholders. Data were thematically analysed
using the Capabilty, Opportunity, Motivation - Behaviour (COM-B) and Theoretical
Domains Framework (TDF). TDF domains were mapped to behaviour change techniques
to inform intervention development. Candidate interventions were refined based
on acceptability, practicability, effectiveness, affordability, side effects,
equity.
RESULTS: Overall, GBMSM stakeholder responses to discontinuing asymptomatic Ng
and Ct screening tended to be negative, while professional stakeholder opinions
were mixed. Reducing the recommended screening frequency to 6 monthly was
generally more acceptable to both groups. Barriers and facilitators to guideline
changes included issues of knowledge and trust, social influence and identity,
context and resources, concerns about consequences and emotional responses and
habit. Ten candidate interventions were suggested. These involve providing
information, social support, behavioural substitutions and feedback as well as
facilitating discussions to resolve concerns.
CONCLUSION: Any reduction in the recommended frequency of asymptomatic screening
will encounter a range of interrelated barriers, including knowledge gaps,
social influences and emotional factors. We identified evidence-based
interventions that could improve acceptance and minimise unintended
consequences. Future research should incorporate stakeholder workshops to refine
these strategies.

Adherence to pediatric HIV therapy continues to be a challenge for achieving the
desired therapeutic outcomes in children due to various factors, the primary one
being the lack of availability of a dose-flexible pediatric combination
formulation. The study thus aimed to create a pediatric-friendly combination of
lamivudine (3TC) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) printlets by examining
how formulation and process variables interact within selective laser sintering
(SLS) 3D printing technology. A Plackett-Burman screening design was used to
pinpoint critical factors impacting product quality. Eight factors, encompassing
both formulation and process parameters, were assessed to identify the main
effects. These include the percentage of combination drug (30-40 %) in a 1:1
ratio, Kollicoat® IR (0-57 %), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (0-67 %), sucrose
(0-67 %), and mannitol (0-57 %), surface (80-100 °C) and chamber temperature
(60-80 °C), and laser scanning speed (250-300 mm/sec). The influence of these
factors was examined in relation to seven responses: angle of repose, hardness,
disintegration time, assay of 3TC, assay of TDF, and dissolution of 3TC and TDF
at 10 min. The results showed that a 1:1 drug ratio with 40 % loading produced
printlets meeting USP assay and dissolution standards. Surface temperature, KCIR
amount, and laser scanning speed significantly influenced printlet performance
(p < 0.05). Characterization techniques, including differential scanning
calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and near-infrared hyperspectral imaging,
confirmed that both drugs were effectively incorporated in the printlets while
maintaining stability and uniformity. Thus, by studying the interplay of
variables and their outcomes alongside characterization studies, this research
supports the use of SLS 3D printing as a promising method for developing
pediatric-friendly combination antiviral therapies that enhance dosing
flexibility and improve adherence potential.

BACKGROUND: Malaysia, an upper middle-income country in the Asia-Pacific region,
has an HIV epidemic that has transitioned from needle sharing to sexual
transmission, mainly in men who have sex with men (MSM). MSM are the most
vulnerable population for HIV in Malaysia. In 2022, our team developed a
web-based artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot and tested its feasibility and
acceptability among MSM in Malaysia to promote HIV testing. To enhance the
usability of the AI chatbot, we made it accessible to the public through the
website called MYHIV365 and tested it in an observational study.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to test the usability of an AI chatbot in promoting
HIV testing among MSM living in Malaysia.
METHODS: This observational study was conducted from August 2023 to March 2024
among 334 MSM. Participants were recruited through community outreach and
social-networking apps using flyers. The interactions between participants and
the AI chatbot were documented and retrieved from the chatbot developer's
platform. Data were analyzed following a predefined metrics using R software
(Posit Software, PBC).
RESULTS: The AI chatbot interacted with 334 participants, assisting them in
receiving free HIV self-testing kits, offering information on HIV, pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP), and mental health, and providing details of 220 MSM-friendly
clinics, including their addresses, phone numbers, and operating hours. After
the study, 393 human-chatbot interactions were documented on the chatbot
developer's platform. Most participants (304/334, 91.0%) interacted with the AI
chatbot once, 30 (9.0%) engaged 2 or more times at different intervals.
Participants' interaction time with the chatbot varied, ranging from 1 to 31
minutes. The AI chatbot properly addressed most participants' questions
(362/393, 92.1%) about HIV and PrEP. However, in 31 interactions, participants
posed additional questions to the chatbot that were not programmed into the
chatbot algorithms, resulting in unanswered interactions.
CONCLUSIONS: The web-based AI chatbot demonstrated high usability in delivering
HIV self-testing kits and providing clinical information on HIV testing, PrEP,
and mental health services. To enhance its usability in community and clinical
settings, the chatbot must offer personalized health information and precise
interaction, powered by sophisticated machine learning algorithms. In addition,
establishing an effective connection between the AI chatbot and health care
systems to eliminate stigma and discrimination toward MSM is crucial for the
future implementation of AI chatbots.

Specific cell types of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), such as pericytes, can be
infected by HIV-1. Importantly, alterations of the expression of tight junction
protein occludin have been linked to regulation of HIV-1 infection. In the
present study, we hypothesized that occludin can influence HIV-1 infection via
modulating innate immunity responses. Unbiased transcriptome analysis was
conducted on wild type and occludin-silenced primary human blood-brain barrier
pericytes. The role of differentially expressed innate-immunity pathways was
then evaluated in the context of mitochondrial dysfunction and HIV-1 infection.
Using a model of ischemic stroke and occludin-deficient mice, we elucidated the
functional role of occludin in cerebrovascular health in the presence of HIV-1
infection. Occludin silencing resulted in alterations of the gene expression
signatures of IFN-stimulated genes and the antiviral retinoic acid-inducible
gene-1 pathway, which functions as a regulator of the cytoplasmic sensors
upstream of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein. Indeed, we observed
dysfunctional mitochondrial bioenergetics, dynamics, and autophagy following
occludin silencing. Alterations of mitochondrial bioenergetics and innate immune
protection translated into worsened ischemic stroke outcomes in EcoHIV-infected
occludin-deficient mice. Animal studies also confirmed that occludin-/- mice had
higher EcoHIV load in plasma, spleen, and brain. Our results allow for a better
understanding of the molecular mechanisms of viral infection in the brain and
describe a previously unrecognized role of occludin as a key factor in the
control of innate immune responses and mitochondrial dynamics at the blood-brain
barrier level, which influence cerebral vascular disease outcomes such as
ischemic stroke.

BACKGROUND: Long-acting regimens are needed to expand antiretroviral therapy
(ART) options for people with HIV-1 (PWH). Combining broadly neutralizing
antibodies (bNAbs) with long-acting small-molecule antiretrovirals may offer an
alternative to daily oral therapy.
METHODS: We conducted a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm trial at AIDS Clinical
Trials Group (ACTG) sites across the U.S. Eligible adults had HIV-1
virologically suppressed on ART for ≥2 years, CD4 ≥350 cells/mm³, and
susceptibility to VRC07-523LS (IC50 ≤0.25 µg/mL; inhibition >98%). Participants
completed an oral cabotegravir (CAB) lead-in (Step 1), then received intravenous
VRC07-523LS (40 mg/kg every 8 weeks) plus intramuscular CAB-LA (every 4 weeks)
for 48 weeks (Step 2), followed by a return to standard ART (Step 3). Primary
outcomes were treatment-related grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs), treatment
discontinuation, and confirmed HIV-1 RNA ≥200 copies/mL by week 44. Virologic
efficacy was assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimates.
RESULTS: Seventy-four participants were enrolled (median age 54; 26% female; 51%
White non-Hispanic). Twelve (17%) experienced a primary safety event: 11 (15%)
had grade ≥3 Aes, primarily transient infusion reactions, and one discontinued
due to a grade 1 infusion event. The cumulative probability of virologic failure
by week 44 was 7% (95% CI, 3%-16%). One participant developed the R263K
integrase resistance mutation.
CONCLUSIONS: The VRC07-523LS plus CAB-LA regimen maintained viral suppression in
93% of participants, with only transient infusion reactions observed; however,
instances of virologic breakthrough suggest that future studies should focus on
optimizing efficacy outcomes. These results support continued investigation of
bNAb-based long-acting ART combinations.

INTRODUCTION: Strongyloidiasis is an important but underdiagnosed
soil-transmitted helminthiasis, particularly in tropical areas and some
vulnerable groups.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the parasitological prevalence, seroprevalence and
sociodemographic factors of Strongyloides stercoralis infection in patients
living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) in an endemic area.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of strongyloidiasis
in 537 PLWH in two hospitals in Iquitos, Peru, from 20 Oct 2023 to 20 May 2024.
We tested patient sera using Strongyloides IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) and stool via the modified Baermann technique and/or charcoal fecal
culture as highly sensitive parasitological techniques. We used multivariable
logistic regression to identify factors associated with S. stercoralis
infection.
RESULTS: Among the 339 PLWH whose stool samples were collected, 82 were positive
for S. stercoralis (prevalence 24.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 20.0-29.1%).
Among the 534 PLWH whose serum samples were collected, 227 were positive
(seroprevalence: 42.5%; 95% CI 38.1-47.5%). The kappa value for charcoal culture
and Baermann technique was 0.69. ELISA showed a sensitivity of 92.6% and a
negative predictive value of 96.9%. Significant risk factors for stool
positivity included living in a rural (unpaved) area (adjusted OR: 1.86),
whereas significant risk factors for both stool and seropositivity included
living in a poor house (made of wood/leaves) (adjusted odds ratio (ORs): 2.18
and 2.48, respectively), in the Loreto Regional Hospital catchment area
(adjusted ORs: 5.66 and 5.37, respectively), or being infected by hookworms in
stool (adjusted ORs: 23.88 and 9.78, respectively). Having a low level of
studies was associated with seropositivity (adjusted OR 2.42).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of S. stercoralis is high among PLWH in Iquitos,
especially among those living in conditions of socioeconomic vulnerability or
co-infected with hookworms. The negative predictive value of the S. stercoralis
ELISA was high, although this result should be taken with caution in severe
immunosuppression.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) transmission is driven by variable social,
environmental, and biological factors, including the number and duration of
indoor contacts. Social contact data can provide information on potential
transmission patterns, but is underutilised outside the field of mathematical
modelling. We explore three contexts where contact data can provide valuable
insights: 1) household contact tracing; 2) infection prevention and control
measures (IPC); and 3) contamination in cluster randomised trials (CRTs). A
social contact survey was conducted in adults aged 18 and older from three
communities with comparable population sizes in South Africa: an urban township
and peri-urban and rural clinic catchment areas. Participants reported
congregate settings visited over 24-hours, visit durations, and estimated number
of people present. To correspond with the three contexts, we estimated the
proportion of contact hours occurring 1) within the home; 2) in congregate
settings outside the home; and 3) outside the participants' communities.
Participants reported a mean of 27.0 (rural), 55.2 (peri-urban), and 73.0
(urban) contact hours. The proportions of household contact were similar among
rural and peri-urban participants (76.8% and 71.7%), compared to urban (48.6%).
Congregate settings visited varied; urban participants spent the most contact
hours in retail/office settings (19.9%), peri-urban participants in
community-service buildings (20.4%), and rural participants in other peoples'
homes (25.5%). Urban participants reported the highest proportion of contact
outside the community (67.0%) compared to rural (38.8%) and peri-urban (21.5%)
participants. The observed heterogeneity in contact patterns has implications
for TB interventions. Household contact tracing may be most effective in the
rural community where household contact was highest. The diverse range of
congregate settings visited suggests that prioritising IPC measures in these
locations may enhance their overall efficacy. Considering contact patterns when
designing clusters may reduce contamination in CRTs. Tailored interventions,

Teenage pregnancy remains a critical issue in Kenya, with 15% of girls aged
15-19 having been pregnant. Counties in western Kenya experience high teenage
pregnancy rates (22-30%) along with high HIV prevalence and widespread poverty.
Long-term consequences of teenage pregnancy have been documented in high-income
countries, but evidence from the Global South is lacking. Here, we examined the
association between teenage pregnancy and adult socio-economic functioning in
western Kenya using cross-sectional survey data from Migori County, Kenya. We
categorized women into three groups: adult mothers (first child ≥20 years),
teenage mothers to 1 child (had 1 child before age 20), and teenage mothers to
2 + children (had 2 or more children before age 20). We then compared adult
socioeconomic and health outcomes of these groups. We found that among 6,089
mothers, 45.2% had their first child during adolescence. Compared to adult
mothers, teenage mothers were significantly less likely to complete primary
education: a 12.2 percentage point (pp) reduction (95% CI: -14.9, -9.4) among
teenage mothers to 1 child and 27.6 pp reduction (95% CI: -31.4, -23.8) among
teenage mothers to 2 + children. Teenage mothers were also more likely to have
loans and experience food insecurity. The risk of experiencing the death of a
child increased from 3.4% among adult mothers to 15.3% among teenage mothers to
2 + children, a 4.5-fold increase (p < 0.001). Teenage mothers also reported
short birth spacing and poor mental health. Our study highlights that teenage
motherhood is associated with worse health and economic functioning that
persists into adulthood. Urgent policy action is needed to address teenage
pregnancy in Kenya to support the economic development of youth and reduce the
risk of HIV infection.

BACKGROUND: Cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) screening and pre-emptive treatment of
antigenaemia can reduce mortality among people living with HIV.
SETTING: We evaluated the effectiveness of a national CrAg screening program in
METHODS: We enrolled a retrospective cohort of adults aged ≥18 years with a CD4
count <100 cells/µL and antigenaemia at 442 facilities in a stratified-random
sample of 27 sub-districts, 2017-2019. We determined a composite outcome of
incident cryptococcal meningitis or death through 6-months.
RESULTS: Overall, 99% (85,791/86,274) of eligible patients had CrAg testing in
the study sub-districts; 5,124 (6.0%) tested CrAg-positive. Among 1,651 with
imaged medical records and without concurrent meningitis, 76% (1,261/1,651) were
outpatients. CrAg results were documented in records for 75% (1,245/1,651). Only
39% (649/1,651) had a meningitis symptom review documented at a median of 14
days (IQR, 5-44) from their CrAg blood draw. Fluconazole was dispensed for 50%
(827/1,651) but only 32% (523/1,651) had an adequate daily dose of ≥800 mg
dispensed. The proportion with meningitis or death within 6-months was 23%
(382/1,651; 95%CI, 19%-27%). Hospitalised patients had a 2.29 higher adjusted
odds of meningitis/death within 6-months versus outpatients (95% CI, 1.72-3.04;
p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Nationwide reflex laboratory CrAg screening was successfully
implemented. However, challenges existed for healthcare providers to act on
positive CrAg results to exclude meningitis and dispense pre-emptive antifungal
therapy. Our findings emphasise the critical need for improved linkage from
reflex CrAg screening to clinical care, in both ambulatory and in-patient
settings, to maintain the effectiveness of this intervention.

OBJECTIVES: Sexual and gender minority (SGM) communities at increased risk of
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may be underprescribed preexposure
prophylaxis (PrEP), but PrEP research on SGM communities other than transgender
women and cisgender men who have sex with men is limited. We sought to better
understand SGM individuals' vulnerability to HIV acquisition and awareness and
perceptions of PrEP in North Carolina, with a focus on SGM groups less often
included in research.
METHODS: We administered a 37-item online survey to adult SGM participants,
examining differences in perceived and behavioral HIV risk based on
self-reported behaviors. We also compared PrEP awareness, prescriptions, and
stigma between SGM identities and used logistic regression to examine
associations between HIV risk and PrEP use.
RESULTS: In total, 372 participants completed the survey. Although 30.9%
reported behaviors that increase the likelihood of HIV acquisition, only 9.5%
perceived their risk as elevated. Most (78.5%) were aware of PrEP, but only
15.1% had been prescribed PrEP. PrEP stigma was most pervasive among cisgender
women. Nonbinary and queer participants were more likely to have experienced
mistreatment by a provider (20.3%, P < 0.0001; 19.2%, P < 0.01) and avoid care
fearing mistreatment (31.9%, P < 0.001; 27.7%; P < 0.001) compared with the
entire sample.
CONCLUSIONS: PrEP is prescribed at low rates across many SGM communities, with
misperception of HIV risk, PrEP stigma, and mistreatment in health care
identified as important barriers. Healthcare providers should take steps to
create a safe environment for SGM patients and ask all patients about HIV risk
factors and provide information about PrEP regardless of sexual orientation or
gender identity.

Public service announcements (PSAs) are a type of media campaign aimed at
creating awareness or influencing behavioral change among viewers. PSAs have
been used to address a range of health issues aimed at varying populations and
have frequently and successfully been used to target adolescents. Focus groups
are conducted with adolescents to elicit ideas and topics, but the PSAs
themselves are created by external media companies. In addition, few published
studies describe the methods of their peer-led programming. The Maneno Yetu
study aimed to fill these gaps by providing descriptions of our PSA creation
workshop process that was peer-driven from conception to completion. Nine PSAs
were created focused on sexual and reproductive health (SRH) issues including
family planning, substance abuse, peer pressure, HIV and sexually transmitted
infections prevention, and sexual assault. The workshop participants enjoyed
learning about storytelling and filmmaking and appreciated participating in a
project that could have a beneficial impact on their peers. Our novel PSA
creation approach was peer-driven from ideation to production and centered on
topics and messaging relevant to adolescents in the communities we were
partnering with. Our approach provided a communication channel to convey
important SRH information tailored to the needs of adolescents in the community.
The PSAs were low-cost, making the approach accessible to adolescents outside of
the framework of a study in resource-limited settings. Our peer-led PSA creation
approach can be applied toward other public health interventions to generate
messaging that resonates with adolescents.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify risk factors for physical frailty
incidence among people with HIV (PWH) and HIV-negative individuals and further
explore the dynamic relationship between major chronic diseases and frailty.
METHODS: PWH and HIV-negative individuals aged ≥40 years from the Comparative
HIV and Aging Research in Taizhou (CHART) cohort were included. Univariate and
multivariate Cox regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR)
and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the association between risk factors and
physical frailty.
RESULTS: A total of 3,968 participants (1,279 cases and 2,689 controls) were
included. Regardless of HIV status, the overall trend of physical frailty
incidence density increased with age, and aging significantly elevated the risk
of frailty. Central obesity (aHR=2.15, 95% CI: 1.09-4.23), hypertension
(aHR=2.06, 95% CI: 1.03-4.11) and current unsuppressed HIV viral load (aHR=2.20,
95% CI: 1.01-4.80) increased the risk of frailty incident among PWH, while
depression (aHR=1.93, 95% CI: 1.06-3.50) and diabetes (aHR=1.85, 95% CI:
1.18-2.90) increased the risk of frailty among HIV-negative controls. Dynamic
Change analyses showed that incident depression, incident neurocognitive
impairment, and persistent hypertension during a 3.18-year follow-up were
associated with a higher risk of frailty among PWH. In contrast, incident
depression, persistent depression, and persistent diabetes were significantly
associated with frailty incidence among HIV-negative controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Aging was significantly associated with a higher risk of physical
frailty regardless of HIV status. Risk factors and the association between
dynamic changes in major chronic diseases and frailty were different between
HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals.

A novel aptamer-based dNTP assay reveals that intact HIV virions are highly
stable and do not contain enough dNTPs to support DNA synthesis.

HIV virions contain high concentrations of IP6 (inositol hexakisphosphate),
which stabilize capsids by binding to pores that allow dNTP to import into
capsids during infection. The concentration of dNTPs in virions, however, is not
known. The low cellular concentrations (~5 µM each) predict only ~1 copy of each
dNTP in a virion, unless a mechanism for concentrating exists, as it does for
IP6. Reports indicating significant DNA synthesis occurring in virions would
require larger amounts of packaged dNTPs or import of dNTPs. We developed a
novel aptamer-based assay capable of detecting 1 femtomole of dNTP, enabling
dNTP measurements in virions. Virions from HEK 293T cells contained dNTPs with
dTTP >dCTP ≈ dATP >dGTP. This order was also observed in uninfected cells.
Concentrations of dNTPs in virions were 2-fold to 4-fold lower than in cells,
although it was unclear if this resulted from uncertainties associated with
estimating virion and cell volumes or real differences. Virions were highly
stable and did not "leak" dNTPs as associated dNTPs were not released, even
after incubation at 60°C for 90 min or several freeze-thaw cycles, a result that
implies diffusion-mediated import of dNTPs into virions is also unlikely.
Overall, results show that dNTPs in intact virions are at or below
concentrations in cells, and even the most abundant dNTP (dTTP) is present at ~1
copy per virion. This precludes significant DNA synthesis in intact virions,
although it is important to note that our assays may not represent all virion
states. The results support a mechanism where dNTPs are passively captured
during virion budding.
IMPORTANCE: HIV virions presumably package small molecules (e.g., amino acids,
cations, and nucleotides) passively during budding. Therefore, they would be
present in virions at cellular levels, unless there is a mechanism for
concentration or exclusion of the molecule (e.g., inositol hexakisphosphate
[IP6], which stabilizes the viral capsid, is present at several-fold greater
concentration in the virion compared with cells). Reports of DNA synthesis
occurring in HIV virions suggest that HIV may also package dNTPs at levels much
higher than predicted by their cellular concentrations, or virions are permeable
to dNTPs. However, we show here that virion dNTP levels are at or below cellular
levels with 1 or fewer molecules of each dNTP in an average virion. Furthermore,
virions did not leak dNTPs when exposed to elevated temperatures or
freeze-thawing, suggesting that they were not permeable. The results suggest
that virions demonstrating significant DNA synthesis may be structurally altered
relative to those measured here.

BACKGROUND: Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) are preferred for
treatment of HIV. However, safety data in pregnancy are limited for newer
INSTIs.
METHODS: Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were randomly allocated to control (water),
dolutegravir, raltegravir, bictegravir, or cabotegravir at clinically relevant
doses, administered orally with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine,
once daily from gestational day (GD) 0.5 to sacrifice (GD15.5). Fetuses were
assessed for gross anomalies. Descriptive statistics were used to compare
proportions of gross anomalies.
FINDINGS: 550 litters (115 control, 150 dolutegravir, 113 raltegravir, 79
bictegravir, 93 cabotegravir) were assessed. Raltegravir was associated with the
highest fetal weight, placental weight, and fetal weight/placenta weight ratio
(placental efficiency). Fetal weight, placental efficiency, and litter size,
were lowest in bictegravir and cabotegravir. Neural tube defects were only
observed in INSTI groups with litter prevalence rates of 0.66% in raltegravir,
0.45% in dolutegravir, 0.39% in bictegravir, 0.15% in cabotegravir, and 0% in
control. Tail defects, eye defects, bleeding defects, cranial swelling, and
growth restriction were significantly more common in all INSTI groups versus
control. Overall rates of defects were lowest in dolutegravir. Compared to
dolutegravir, limb and tail defects (indicative of spinal dysraphism) were
significantly more prevalent in the raltegravir group, while bleeding defects
were significantly more prevalent in the bictegravir and cabotegravir groups.
INTERPRETATION: While INSTIs represent a critical advance in the management of
HIV infection, the findings of this study demonstrate a link between INSTI
therapy and adverse fetal outcomes. This highlights the need for continued
surveillance of pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to INSTIs.

OBJECTIVES: Undiagnosed HIV infection remains the main driver of new HIV cases
in Western countries. Emergency Departments (EDs) offer a key opportunity for
detection. In 2020, Spanish emergency and infectious diseases societies
recommended an opt-in strategy for targeted conditions for HIV testing in EDs.
This study evaluates the efficacy of three strategies for targeted HIV testing.
METHODS: Twelve Spanish EDs, selected based on predefined structural criteria,
assessed HIV testing from April to June 2024. Hospitals applied: no strategy
(control, three EDs), an educational programme (strategy A, three EDs), strategy
A plus preconfigured electronic orders (strategy B, three EDs) or strategy B
plus electronic alerts in medical records (strategy C, three EDs). The impact on
HIV testing was measured overall and by targeted condition, using absolute
differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Of the 612 909 ED visits, 210 039 occurred in control hospitals (1232
patients [0.59%] had targeted conditions), 172 806 in hospitals applying
strategy A (1497 [0.87%]), 132 835 in strategy B hospitals (1761 [1.33%]) and
97 229 in hospitals applying strategy C (1269 [1.31%]). Testing rates were
0.16%, 0.38%, 1.17% and 2.16% in the control, and strategy A, B and C EDs.,
respectively. Among patients with targeted conditions, testing reached 13.1%,
22.9%, 30.7% and 78.1%. Compared to no strategy, testing increased by 0.22% (95%
CI = 0.18-0.25) with strategy A, 0.79% (95% CI = 0.73-0.86) with B, and 0.98%
(95% CI = 0.88-1.09) with C. In targeted conditions, testing rose by 9.8%, 7.8%
and 47.5% for strategies A, B and C, respectively. All strategies improved
testing in sexually transmitted infections (STI), meningitis/neurological
syndromes and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP); strategy C also increased
testing in herpes zoster (HZ) and post-exposure prophylaxis.
CONCLUSION: All the strategies evaluated enhanced targeted HIV testing,
especially strategy C (electronic alerts), which was associated with the highest
testing rates observed, particularly in STI, CAP and HZ.

Individuals attending mpox vaccine-only visits at an STI clinic were more likely
to be new patients with high socioeconomic status and identify as White than
those vaccinated during non-mpox related visits. A small number received HIV
PrEP or testing following vaccination; this may represent a missed opportunity
for HIV prevention.

INTRODUCTION: Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) can cause serious complications in
both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed individuals. This study aims to assess
the seroprevalence of T. gondii among HIV-positive individuals and to
investigate its association with age, sex, CD4+ T cell count, HIV RNA levels,
and hematological parameters.
METHODS: This study included 247 HIV-positive individuals followed up at a
tertiary care hospital between November 1, 2022, and November 30, 2024. We
analyzed serum samples for T. gondii IgG antibodies using
electrochemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay.
RESULTS: The prevalence of T. gondii IgG seropositivity was found to be 32.8%
(n=81; 95% CI: 26.9-39). The median age of seropositive individuals was 52 years
(IQR: 42-61), which was significantly higher compared to seronegative
individuals (p<0.001). The highest IgG seropositivity rate (66.7%) was observed
in the 61-80 age group. Hemoglobin levels were significantly lower in IgG
seropositive individuals (p=0.040). Logistic regression analysis indicated an
increased risk of T. gondii infection with advancing age. The odds ratio for the
41-60 age group was 13.3 (95% CI: 1.6-106, p=0.02), while for the 61-80 age
group, it was 28 (95% CI: 3.3-240, p=0.002).
DISCUSSION: The seroprevalence of T. gondii in HIV-positive individuals was
lower than both global and regional averages. Age was identified as an
independent risk factor for T. gondii seropositivity. Additionally,
hematological alterations associated with anemia were observed in seropositive
individuals. Further large-scale, multi-center, and regionally representative
studies are required to optimize T. gondii infection management and screening
strategies in people living with HIV.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that T. gondii infection in HIV-positive
individuals increases with age and may be associated with anemia, highlighting
the need for age-focused screening and management strategies.

BACKGROUND: Current hepatitis C virus (HCV) guidelines recommend testing at
least once in a lifetime for all adults and periodic testing for people with
ongoing risk factors. However, the testing frequency required for these
populations including people who inject drugs (PWID) remains unknown.
METHODS: We developed a dynamic network model to simulate HCV transmission among
PWID via sharing of injection equipment. We simulated different testing
frequencies among PWID, paired with a treatment cascade of direct-acting
antiviral therapy, and compared their impact on HCV infection prevalence,
incidence, and HCV-related deaths over 10 years. We conducted sensitivity
analyses on key parameters and assumptions.
RESULTS: In the main analysis, testing on average once per six months reduced
HCV infection prevalence, incidence, and HCV-related deaths by up to 45%, 37%,
and 42%, respectively. In the sensitivity analyses, increased coverage (access
and utilization) had the greatest impact on all three outcomes, and reinfection
risk after cure had a substantial impact on incidence. Lower transmission risk,
higher cessation rate of injection, and longer partnership duration decreased
the three outcomes with or without HCV testing.
CONCLUSIONS: Frequent HCV testing with treatment had a substantial impact on
hepatitis C elimination outcomes. However, it alone in the context of current
continuum of care among PWID is unlikely to be sufficient to achieving
elimination. Improving access to and utilization of hepatitis C care and
harm-reduction services among PWID are crucial to achieving elimination.

HIV infection accelerates biological aging, but the contribution of the host's
age to this process is unknown. We investigated the influence of SIV infection
in macaques (SIVmac) on the risk of comorbidities and aging in young and old
rhesus macaques (RMs) by assessing pathogenesis markers, DNA methylation-based
epigenetic age (EA), and EA acceleration (EAA) in blood and tissues. Initially,
upon SIV infection, the young RMs showed greater resilience to CD4+ T cell
depletion, better control of T cell activation, hypercoagulation, and excessive
inflammation, yet this resilience was progressively lost in the advanced stages
of infection. During the late stages of infection, the young RMs, but not the
aged ones, showed an increase in EA in PBMCs; also, EAA in the cerebellum and
heart of young RMs was higher compared with old RMs. SIV infection was more
pathogenic in aged animals in early stages, leading to a more rapid disease
progression; however, accelerated aging mostly affected young animals, so that
the levels of multiple key pathogenesis markers in the young RMs converged
toward those specific to aged ones in the late stages of infection. We conclude
that SIV infection-driven age acceleration is tissue specific, and that host age
influences the susceptibility of different tissues to enhanced aging.

The evolution of HIV-1 virulence has significant implications for epidemic
control. Recent phylogenomic analyses identified low-prevalence HIV-1 variants
exhibiting significant differences in disease progression. We analysed 40 888
partial HIV-1 pol sequences from the UK HIV Drug Resistance Database (UKRDB)
across subtypes B, C, A1, and CRF02AG. We identified phylotypes with putative
differences in transmission/phylogenetic patterns and assessed their virulence
trends using pretreatment viral loads, CD4 cell counts, and four statistical
methods. We classified three subtype B phylotypes-PT.B.40.UK, PT.B.69.UK, and
PT.B.133.UK -as variants of interest (VOIs) due to significantly higher viral
loads and/or accelerated CD4 decline. PT.B.40.UK and PT.B.69.UK exhibited higher
viral loads, 4.93 log10 copies/ml (95% CI: 4.73-5.13) and 4.87 (4.65-5.10),
representing 0.30-0.36 log10 copies/ml higher than the reference group (4.57;
4.55-4.59). Despite uncertainties in baseline CD4 counts, all three VOIs reached
the clinically relevant threshold of 350 CD4 cells/mm3 significantly faster than
the reference group (3.5 years, 3.1-3.9 years): 2.3 years (1.0-5.1) for
PT.B.40.UK, 2.0 years (10.8 months-4.4 years) for PT.B.69.UK, and 1.8 years
(10.8 months-3.6 years) for PT.B.133.UK. These VOIs and their closest relatives
have been circulating in the UK for decades with limited international spread
and did not exhibit unusually rapid growth rates. Although these findings
suggest a heritable high-virulence HIV-1 phenotype, we did not find evidence
that convergent genetic polymorphisms or switches in coreceptor usage explained
these differences. The small fraction of HIV-1 subtype B variants in the UK
evolving towards higher virulence is unlikely to pose a public health concern,
given the ongoing decline in new HIV diagnoses following the widespread adoption
of pre-exposure prophylaxis and targeted prevention campaigns. However, this
study-alongside the detection of the VB variant in the Netherlands-demonstrates
that more virulent variants are not rare and can emerge independently in
multiple countries. Consequently, HIV-1 genomic surveillance remains crucial to
monitor HIV-1 virulence and mitigate its healthcare impact.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Oral candidiasis (OC) is a common condition in
HIV-infected individuals. This study aimed to identify the prevalence,
associated factors, and causative agents of OC among HIV-infected patients in a
general hospital in Vietnam.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 393 HIV-infected individuals treated
at The Tropical Diseases Center, Nghe An General Friendship Hospital, Vinh, Nghe
An, Vietnam from January 2022 to May 2024. The sample collected from the buccal
mucosa was seeded onto CHROMagarTM Candida to isolate and identify the causative
yeasts. Molecular identification was performed with restriction fragment length
polymorphism assay using MspI restriction enzyme and sequencing of the internal
transcribed spacer (ITS) region.
RESULTS: The prevalence of OC was 10.7% (95% confidence interval 7.6 - 13.8).
Patients with late WHO HIV clinical stage, poorer hygienic condition, or use of
prosthetic were at a higher risk of OC. Ten yeast species were isolated, and 10
(23.8%) patients carried more than one type of yeast species. Out of 54 obtained
isolates, Candida albicans comprised the most (62.9% isolates and 80.9%
patients), followed by C. tropicalis (16.4% and 21.4% respectively). Overall, 27
patients (64.3%) were infected with C. albicans, and 15 patients (35.7%) were
infected with non- albicans Candida, alone or in combination with C. albicans.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of OC in HIV-infected patients was low and associated
with both systemic and local factors. C. albicans was still the most common
species but non- albicans Candida or coexistence of Candida species is frequent.

Introduction: Screening donated blood for transfusion-transmitted infections
(TTIs) is a critical component of transfusion safety, particularly in
high-demand regions such as Makkah City, Saudi Arabia. This study is aimed at
assessing the seroprevalence of TTI markers among blood donors at King Abdulaziz
Hospital-Makkah (KAHM) over a 7-year period. Methods: In this retrospective
study, 17,661 individuals who donated blood at the KAHM, Saudi Arabia, from
January 2017 to December 2023, were included. The prevalence of TTI markers was
assessed and categorized by year, gender, age, type of donors (whole blood and
apheresis), and category of donation (replacement and volunteer). In addition to
ABO group testing, commercially available kits were used for serological tests.
Results: Among donors, 74 (0.42%) were reactive for HBsAg, 1419 (8.03%) for
HBcAb, and 1295 (7.33%) for HBsAb. Other reactive cases included HCV (0.29%),
HIV (0.06%), HTLV-I/II (0.05%), and syphilis (0.44%). No cases of malaria were
reported. Statistically significant variations were observed across years for
HBsAg (p = 0.007), HBsAb, and HBcAb (p < 0.001), suggesting changes in infection
exposure, immunity, or donor screening efficiency. Male donors represented
97.17% of the cohort, and replacement donors were more prevalent (54.75%) than
volunteers. Conclusion: The overall prevalence of TTIs among blood donors in
Makkah was low, affirming the effectiveness of current screening protocols.
However, the relatively high prevalence of hepatitis B core antibodies indicates
prior exposure among a notable proportion of donors. Yearly fluctuations in
seropositivity suggest evolving epidemiological patterns, warranting continuous
surveillance and targeted public health interventions.

BACKGROUND: Manipur, a north-eastern state of India, has a high incidence of
intravenous drug use with an equally high prevalence of Hepatitis C virus (HCV)
OBJECTIVES: This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the impact of certain
risk factors enhancing the susceptibility of acquiring HCV.
DESIGN: A total of 1008 participants from various risk groups, from nine
districts across the state, were enrolled. Blood samples along with demographic
data were collected from the study participants.
METHODS: HCV RNA was isolated and nested RT-PCR was performed followed by Sanger
sequencing for genotyping. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies were further
conducted.
RESULTS: Of the total, 493 (48.90%) samples were HCV sero-reactive. Among the
sero-reactive samples, 406 (82.35%) were HCV RNA positive. In case of the
subgroup PWID + HIV, sero-reactivity (82.22%) and viremia (90.54%) were observed
to be exceptionally high. It was noted that HCV sero-reactivity increased four
times in people living with HIV (PLHIV) who continued to inject drugs. Three HCV
genotypes and eight subtypes were circulating in this study population.
CONCLUSION: In PLHIV who continued to inject drugs, HCV sero-reactivity
increased four-fold. About 40% of the population living with HCV belonged to
genotype 6, while genotype 1 showed a noticeable decline. Phylogeographic
analyses and spatiotemporal reconstructions revealed that most of the subtypes
migrated from far south-east Asian countries like Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar,
and Singapore.

Molecular HIV surveillance is used to in effort to enhance HIV prevention
efforts by identifying emerging clusters of rapid HIV transmission. In the
United States, it relies upon data from antiretroviral resistance testing done
in the context of clinical care. However, information about the public health
uses of these data are not always disclosed to patients at the time of testing,
which raises ethical concerns. Building upon accumulating data about this
practice, a multidisciplinary group argues that there is a need to increase
transparency of the practice through active disclosure.

Background: Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) remains a significant global
public health challenge, particularly in regions with a high burden of TB.
Nepal, one such country, has been witnessing a rise in DR-TB cases, posing
serious challenges to TB control efforts. Despite this growing concern, there is
a lack of localized data on the risk factors contributing to DR-TB, especially
in urban areas like Pokhara. This study aims to fill that gap by assessing the
prevalence of DR-TB and identifying associated demographic, behavioral, and
clinical factors among TB patients in Pokhara Metropolitan City, Gandaki
Province, Nepal. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis was conducted
using 617 TB patient records from the Pokhara Metropolitan Health Office for the
fiscal year 2078/79 (July 2021 to July 2022). Data on demographic
characteristics, clinical history, treatment regimens, and behavioral factors
such as smoking and alcohol consumption were extracted. Descriptive statistics
were used to determine the prevalence of DR-TB, and bivariate logistic
regression was applied to identify statistically significant risk factors
associated with DR-TB. Results: Among the 617 TB patients, the prevalence of
DR-TB was 2.6%. Most patients were male (57.4%) and within the 21-30 age group
(26.9%). Pulmonary bacteriologically confirmed TB was the most common type
(53.6%), predominantly affecting adults (98.1%). The primary treatment regimen
administered was 2HRZE + 4HR (78.8%). TB-HIV co-infection was found in 1.9% of
cases, with all co-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. In a
bivariate analysis, individuals with current smoking status (UOR: 9.384; CI:
3.342-26.351), exposure to smoking (UOR: 8.550: CI: 2.916-25.064), and current
alcohol consumption (UOR: 4.553, CI: 1.406-14.745) had a higher likelihood of
DR-TB. In a multivariate analysis, exposure to smoking (AOR: 5.317; CI:
1.394-20.274) and current alcohol consumption (AOR: 6.84; CI: 2.071-22.58)
emerged as independent predictors associated with an increased risk of DR-TB.
Conclusion: The study revealed a relatively low prevalence of DR-TB among TB
patients in Pokhara, with strong associations between DR-TB and lifestyle
factors such as smoking and alcohol use. These findings underscore the need for
targeted public health interventions addressing behavioral risk factors to
reduce DR-TB incidence. Enhanced surveillance, public awareness, and preventive
strategies should be integrated into TB control programs to mitigate the spread
of DR-TB in this region. Moreover, targeted behavioral interventions may be
crucial in curbing the emergence of DR-TB, particularly in high-burden urban
centers.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the college students' awareness, knowledge, attitude, and
source of information on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
METHODS: This is a multicenter study with 490 college students participated in
the questionnaire survey. Among them, 261 are medical students and 229 are
non-medical students. A questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic data
and investigate the awareness of and knowledge about HIV infection, the practice
of preventive measures, and sources of HIV-related information.
RESULTS: There is no significantly different on self-report awareness of HIV
infection between medical and non-medical students (P = 0.919). However, a
higher proportion of non-medical students misunderstand the HIV transmission
routes. For the sources of knowledge, non-medical students were more likely to
obtain from the Internet (P=0.029), TV medias (P=0.027) and others (P=0.032).
The proportion of medical students acquiring HIV-related knowledge from doctors
was significantly higher (P<0.001). A higher percentage of non-medical students
indicated a lack of HIV knowledge and expressed a need for more HIV related
education (P=0.002). Non-medical students expressed a preference for HIV
education that covers a broader spectrum of HIV-related knowledge (P=0.046),
indicating a desire for more comprehensive understanding beyond basic
HIV-related awareness. In contrast, medical students indicated a preference for
more frequent sessions with longer durations (P=0.038).
CONCLUSION: Medical students were significantly more aware of HIV related
knowledge than the non-medical students. Our research can provide relevant data
support for further improving the methods and content of health education for
young people.

BACKGROUND: The ultra-portable digital x-ray (UPDX) with computer-aided
detection (CAD) is a new technology aimed at bringing tuberculosis (TB)
screening innovations to hard-to-reach communities and strengthening the active
case-finding (ACF) interventions for TB. As TB control measures remain critical
globally and in Nigeria, the country acquired and rolled out 10 UPDX with
computer-aided detection (CAD4TB) software in eight states. This study seeks to
evaluate the efficiency and impact of the UPDX with CAD4TB for TB case finding
in Nigeria.
METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study involving the review of records
of individuals 4 years and above who had presented for TB screening during ACF
activities conducted using the UPDX with CAD4TB between January 2022 and
September 2022.
RESULTS: A total of 94,694 subjects aged 4 years and above were screened for TB
with an average presumptive TB proportion of 10.84 ± 5.42% and 10% confirmed TB
(r = 0.684, p = 0.03 and r(df) = 0.867, p = 0.001). The number needed to screen
(NNS) to find one TB case in Northern Nigeria was 39 as against 37 for the South
(χ 2 = 108, p = 0.25), with correlations (r = -0.422, p = 0.17 and
r(df) = -0.575, p = 0.05). Similarly, a comparison of the number needed to test
(NNT) to find one TB case in Northern and Southern Nigeria gave a North total of
four against a South total of five (χ 2 = 60, p = 0.3), with correlations
(r = -0.033, p = 0.92 and r(df) = -0.212, p = 0.51). Among the TB cases
confirmed, 3.4% were asymptomatic with cough and fever absent in 18.2% and
83.2%, respectively. The average time to diagnosis (TTD) was 2.0 ± 1.04 days
while the average time to treatment (TTT) was 4.2 ± 1.14 days, with 50.6%
receiving same-day diagnosis and 34.5% receiving same-day treatment. The
cumulative risks of radiation exposure on healthcare workers using UPDX with
CAD4TB and adhering to personal protective practices were found to be low.
CONCLUSION: We documented the usefulness of UPDX with CAD showing a high TB
prevalence and test positivity rate, with significant burden of subclinical TB.
This has highlighted the need to scale up its use for ACF for TB and select CAD
thresholds for both children and adults.

Inferring fitness seascapes from evolutionary histories.
Gao Y, Lee B, Barton JP.
Evolutionary dynamics are often conceptualized as walks on an adaptive
landscape, with populations climbing toward optimal fitness peaks. However,
environmental changes can transform static landscapes into dynamic "fitness
seascapes" where natural selection fluctuates in time. Here, we used a path
integral approach derived from statistical physics to reveal time-varying
selection pressures from genetic sequence data. We found that constraints on the
fitness seascape are determined by the screened Poisson equation, which also
describes the screening of electric fields in media with mobile charge carriers.
In our model, changes in mutation frequencies act as "charges" that reveal the
underlying fitness seascape, which is analogous to an electrostatic potential.
After validating our method in simulations, we applied it to study how HIV-1
evolves to escape immune control by T cells within individual hosts. Our
analysis showed that the fitness benefit of immune escape declines as T cell
responses approach their peak intensity, suggesting that functional exhaustion
may impair the effectiveness of the immune response against HIV-1. Overall, our
approach provides a general framework for capturing the complex dynamics of
natural selection in rapidly evolving populations.

Persistent infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is the primary cause of
cervical cancer worldwide. Notably, women co-infected with HPV and human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) have a six-fold higher lifetime risk of
developing cervical cancer compared to those without HIV, even when adhering to
antiretroviral therapy (ART) and achieving T-cell reconstitution. While chronic
HIV-1 infection is known to cause inflammation, how paracrine signals from
immune cells alter signaling in cervical cells remain poorly understood. To
address this, we conducted global transcriptomics analysis on cervical swabs
from Kenyan women with HPV, stratified by HIV-1 and cancer status. Strikingly,
women with HIV-1 showed cancer-like gene expression patterns in non-cancerous
cervical epithelial cells. Complementary global mass spectrometry (MS)
proteomics of cervical cells exposed to the secretome of HIV-1 infected primary
CD4+ T-cells revealed altered expression of proteins in MAPK, PI3K-AKT, and
β-catenin signaling pathways. Integrative network analyses of transcriptomic and
proteomic datasets revealed that HIV-1 altered gene expression in key pathways
known to drive cervical cancer, including genes commonly mutated in HIV-1-naïve
disease. Notably, IRS-1, a key PI3K-AKT pathway activator, was found to be
consistently upregulated in both participant samples and cell culture models, as
were interferon-stimulated genes. Phosphoproteomics MS analysis confirmed
PI3K-AKT pathway activation in cervical cells exposed to conditioned media from
HIV-1-infected T-cells. Together, our findings uncover how HIV-1 reshapes
cervical cell signaling via paracrine mechanisms and highlights the PI3K pathway
as a potential therapeutic target in HIV-associated cervical cancer.

The real-world association between male circumcision and risk of HIV infection
in sub-Saharan Africa: a household fixed-effects analysis of 279,351 men from 29
countries.

Ortblad KF, Bärnighausen T.
INTRODUCTION: While voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) reduces the
individual- level risk of HIV acquisition by approximately 60% in
randomised-controlled trials, little is known about the 'real-world' long-term
effect of medical and traditional male circumcision on the cumulative risk of
HIV infection. We estimate the association between these for the first time
using a quasi-experimental study design-a household fixed-effects analysis-for
sub- Saharan Africa, the global region with the largest HIV burden.
METHODS: We pooled individual-level cross-sectional data from the
nationally-representative Demographic and Health Surveys and AIDS Indicator
Surveys across all sub-Saharan African countries in which the surveys included
data on both male circumcision and HIV status. We estimated the association
between male circumcision and HIV status using modified Poisson regression
models with household fixed-effects-which control for unobserved and observed
confounding shared by men living in the same household-and included additional
individual- level controls for demographic characteristics, socio-economic
factors, and sexual behaviour.
RESULTS: We included individual data from 279,351 male participants in 48
nationally- representative surveys conducted in 29 countries between 2003-2018.
The mean survey-level prevalence of male circumcision was 65.9% (median 84.5%,
IQR 28.8%-68.1%) and HIV was 5.6% (median 2.5%, IQR 1.2%-10.2%). We estimated
that male circumcision was significantly associated with a nearly one-fifth
reduction in the cumulative risk of HIV infection (adjusted risk ratio 0.81, 95%
CI 0.73-0.89).
CONCLUSIONS: Male circumcision was associated with a significant reduction in
the risk of HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa over the past two decades.
Increased political and financial commitment to VMMC could likely lead to
further reductions in HIV prevalence, especially when rolled out as a HIV
prevention option in combination with other interventions.

INTRODUCTION: Since July 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) has
recommended dolutegravir (DTG)-based regimens as preferred first-line
antiretroviral therapy (ART) for adults and adolescents living with HIV
(DTG-for-All), a reversal of a 2018 safety alert on use of DTG-based regimens by
women of reproductive age (WRA). We examined sex and age disparities in DTG
uptake before and after DTG-for-All in the International epidemiology Databases
to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA).
METHODS: We included patients ≥16 years on or initiating treatment between
January 2017 and July 2021 in 14 low- and middle-income countries where initial
guidelines on DTG-based regimens for first-line ART either restricted use by WRA
or had no such restrictions. We estimated the cumulative incidence of DTG uptake
(CI-DTG) by sex and age group (aged 16-49 years vs. 50+ years), stratified by
patient, clinic and setting characteristics.
RESULTS: Among 177,706 patients on ART during the study period, 51% were females
aged 16-49 years, with 25% males aged 16-49, and 13% and 11%, respectively,
females and males aged 50+. At the time of DTG-for-All, overall CI-DTG was 29.6%
(95%CI: 29.4, 29.8); it was lower among females aged 16-49 (16.2%; 95%CI:
16.0-16.5) than males (41.1%; 95%CI: 40.6, 41.5), with no sex disparities among
patients aged 50+ (females: 46.0%; males: 47.0%). While DTG uptake subsequently
increased among all groups, by July 2021, it remained substantially lower among
females 16-49 (66.4%; 95%CI: 66.1, 66.7), compared with males 16-49 and older
females and males (75.8% to 77.5%). Concentrated in countries where initial
guidelines on DTG restricted use by WRA, disparities in DTG uptake persisted at
all health system levels and in both low-income and lower-middle income
CONCLUSIONS: While sex-age differentials in DTG uptake narrowed after WHO's
DTG-for-All recommendation, lingering disparities uptake underscore the
challenges of policy de-implementation when new evidence emerges.
KEY MESSAGES: What is already known on this topic: Prior research illuminated
substantial sex and age group disparities in uptake of dolutegravir (DTG)-based
antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens among people with HIV (PLHIV)-disparities
that emerged after the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a May 2018 drug
safety alert for women of reproductive age (WRA) and persisted after subsequent
guidance in July 2019 recommending DTG-based regimens as preferred first-line
treatment for all adults and adolescents, irrespective of age and sex.What this
study adds: Drawing on real-world service delivery data from 72 clinics in 14
countries, this study documents the persistence of sex and age group disparities
in DTG-based regimen uptake. Concentrated in low- and lower-middle income
countries where national guidelines initially contained restrictions on use of
DTG by WRA, these disparities remained substantial at two and three years after
WHO's "dolutegravir for all" guidance among treatment-naïve and
treatment-experienced PLHIV and were observed at all health system levels.How
this study might affect research, practice or policy: Our study underscores the
substantial lags that can occur in updating, disseminating, and translating new
policy guidance into practice, as well as the challenges of de-implementing
outdated policy recommendations when new evidence emerges-challenges that will
remain relevant with new treatment regimens, such as injectable ART, on the
horizon.

Introduction: Early human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing of partners or
families of the index case is an innovative type of testing which is performed
within 14 days after contact elicitation using a contractual referral approach.
Testing within this time is very important because it helps to identify contacts
early and enroll them for intervention timely. In most health facilities, the
contractual approach was not practiced; by implementing this early index case
testing, most contacts could be tested early and it could prevent them from
HIV-related death. Objective: This study aimed to assess the magnitude and
associated factors of early index case testing among adult HIV index cases in
Debre Markos town high case load health facilities. Methods: Institution-based
cross-sectional study was conducted on adult index cases who started
antiretroviral therapy from December 1/2018 to August 30/2022. A total of 384
index case charts were selected by the systematic random sampling technique
using their medical record number from January 23/2023 up to February 28/2023.
After the data were collected using a structured checklist, they were entered
into EpiData Version 4.6 and then exported to SPSS software Version 25 for data
cleaning, coding, categorizing, and further analysis. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test
goodness of fit was checked for model fitness. Both bivariable and multivariable
logistic regression analyses were used to identify significant factors with
early testing of index cases' families. Finally, variables having pvalue < 0.05
with 95% CI in the multivariable logistic regression are considered as
significant factors. Result: In this study, the magnitude of early index case
testing among adult index patients was 28.6% (95% CI: 27.17%-30.0%). Being
female (AOR = 1.89, 95% CI (1.17-3.06)), urban resident index cases (AOR = 1.88,
95% CI (1.16-3.03)), and having disclosure status (AOR = 2.34, 95% CI
(1.40-3.92)) were significantly associated with early index case testing.
Conclusion: This study examines the prevalence and key factors influencing early
index case HIV testing among adult patients in Debre Markos town. By identifying
critical determinants such as gender, residence, and disclosure status, it
provides valuable insights into how early testing can be enhanced to reduce
transmission and improve health outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Point-of-care (POC) urine tenofovir (TFV) tests can provide timely
information regarding antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence to support
management of HIV treatment in clinics. However, there are limited data on the
costs and feasibility of integrating POC testing into HIV clinics in sub-Saharan
Africa. We characterized clinic flow and implementation costs of POC adherence
testing for persons initiating ART in HIV care clinics in South Africa.
METHODS: We conducted a microcosting within a randomized controlled
implementation trial of POC TFV test in government clinics in Durban, South
Africa (STREAM HIV). Time-and-motion observation was conducted between 1st March
and 31st December 2022, to assess staff and client time needed for POC TFV
testing and counselling. We estimated both financial and economic costs for
capital, clinic consumables and personnel using a provider (national government)
perspective.
RESULTS: The estimated cost of POC TFV was USD $13 per client, assuming a clinic
volume of 20 individuals initiating ART per month. The largest component costs
of POC TFV testing were the test strip consumables, which accounted for 53% of
the test cost. The median total time of a clinic visit with a POC TFV test,
starting from client registration, was 49:19 (minutes: seconds) (IQR:
29:19-89:35). TFV testing took 9:22 (IQR: 7:35-14:11), taking up 19% of the
total clinic visit time, including sample collection, sample loading, TFV test
processing and counselling provision based on test results. Overall, 29% of the
clinic visit time included direct clinical care and assessment with a provider,
with clients spending a median 14:09 (IQR: 10:35-21:22) getting vitals checked,
receiving adherence monitoring via POC TFV testing, and collecting their ART
refill. Waiting in line for ART took most (48%) of the clinic visit time.
CONCLUSIONS: POC TFV testing can be administered at reasonable costs, requires
less than 10 minutes of healthcare provider time, and, therefore, may be
feasible to implement in South African clinics. Findings can inform policy and
budgetary planning for ART monitoring in South Africa and future
cost-effectiveness analyses of POC TFV testing.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recruiting blood donors among a population with a
high human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) burden requires detailed information on
HIV risks. We studied demographic and behavioural risk factors for incident HIV
infection among blood donors in South Africa.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study. Incident HIV was
defined as HIV antibody negative and RNA positive, or concordant serology and
RNA positive with a limiting antigen avidity assay optical density of <1.5.
Cases were matched to infection-negative controls (ratio 1:3) on race, age and
geography. Risk factors in the 6 months before donation were ascertained by
audio computer-assisted self-interview. Data were fitted using separate
multivariable logistic regression models for males and females.
RESULTS: From April 2014 to March 2017, we enrolled 323 people with incident HIV
and 877 controls. Among women, incident HIV was associated with sex with a
person living with HIV (PLWH) or unknown HIV status, multiple male sex partners,
never or occasional condom use, anal preparation before sex, first-time donor
status and referral to donation by a healthcare worker. Among men, incident HIV
was associated with being aged 31-40 years, sex with a PLWH or unknown HIV
status, multiple sex partners, more than four lifetime male sex partners,
gay/bisexual identity, marriage or stable partnership, lower education,
penetrative injury, occasional condom use and first-time or lapsed donor status.
Some novel or indirect risks for incident HIV were also observed.
CONCLUSION: We confirmed the known sexual behaviours asked on the donor
screening questionnaire. The findings highlight ongoing challenges in donor
disclosure during selection and the importance of donor education.

BACKGROUND: HIV/AIDS continues to exert a significant toll on health care
systems and governments worldwide, including in Kyrgyzstan, impacting the health
and well-being of millions. The aim of this study was to examine how the
patterns of HIV transmission in Kyrgyzstan evolved between 2012 and 2022.
METHODS: This ecological study employed retrospective data collection.
Quantitative methods were employed to assess and analyse changes in patterns of
HIV transmission, as well as co-infections such as HIV + hepatitis B virus (HBV)
and HIV + hepatitis C virus (HCV), across individuals with varying modes of HIV
acquisition. Data encompassed all diagnosed HIV cases from 2012 to 2022 across
Chui, Talas, Naryn, Issik-Kol, Batken, Osh, Jalal-Abad oblasts, Bishkek and Osh.
RESULTS: HIV incidence increased from 8.36 to 14.56 per 100 000 populations
between 2013 and 2022, with the most significant rise among females, from 8.42
per 100 000 in 2020 to 11.72 per 100 000 in 2022. The study also highlighted an
increase in new HIV cases via heterosexual transmission (from 71.7% in 2020 to
81.9% in 2022), and men who have sex with men (MSM)transmission (from 40 cases
in 2020 to 75 cases in 2022), while transmission among people who inject drugs
dropped significantly (from 201 cases in 2017 to 21 cases in 2022). Notably,
there were reductions in new HIV infections through vertical transmission,
medical procedures and co-infections with HIV + HBV and HIV + HCV.
CONCLUSION: Between 2012 and 2022, HIV incidence saw a significant rise,
especially among individuals aged 18-29 and 30-39 years, with a marked increase
among females. The study revealed a shift in transmission modes over this
period. While new infections among people who inject drugs declined, there was
an uptick in cases reported among MSM and the general population in the country.

Primary HIV-associated thrombocytopenia (PHAT) is an isolated thrombocytopenia
in HIV-positive individuals in the absence of secondary causes. The presence of
certain Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) has been linked to individuals' immune
response to HIV and the development of immune-mediated thrombocytopenic
disorders. Considering the established associations between HLA and HIV
infection and HLA and immune-mediated thrombocytopenias, we hypothesise that
specific HLA alleles may also increase the risk of developing PHAT, a condition
that links both HIV and immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. Therefore, the study
aimed to determine the frequency of high-resolution HLA alleles in patients
presenting with possible PHAT. Following a detailed screening process, we
evaluated the HLA profiles of 43 participants with probable PHAT using the Axiom
Precision Medicine Diversity Array (PMDA) Kit on the GeneTitan Multi-Channel
instrument. No single HLA allele was found to be more prominent in our PHAT
population. However, 93.02% of participants had both HIV-protective and
HIV-susceptible alleles. The potential mechanism causing thrombocytopenia to be
the only clinically relevant haematological abnormality in these patients
remains to be explored. We concluded that the presence of both an HIV-protective
and HIV-susceptibility allele in the same individual may cause antagonistic
immune reactions, resulting in thrombocytopenia in HIV-positive individuals. We
propose future long-term follow-up studies to determine the progression and
outcome in patients with PHAT.

BACKGROUND: The genetic diversity of HIV is significantly influenced by
second-generation recombination events involving circulating recombinant forms
(CRFs) and unique recombinant forms (URFs), which are crucial for the virus's
evolution and dissemination. The China-Myanmar border region is recognized as a
focal point for inter-subtype recombination of HIV, with recombinant strains
predominating in this area.
METHODS: Near full-length HIV genomes were amplified from plasma samples of
eight Burmese individuals newly diagnosed with HIV in Baoshan, China, from 2006
to 2020. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using maximum likelihood methods,
and Bootscan analysis was conducted to identify recombination structures.
RESULTS: Among the eight sequences, one (YN33F28) clustered with subtype C, and
one (YN9M24) with CRF08_BC. The remaining six sequences did not cluster with any
known HIV subtypes, indicating they might represent novel recombinant strains.
Bootscan analysis revealed that three sequences (YN36F38, YN35F22, and YN32M22)
were likely formed through second-generation recombination involving known CRFs
(CRF82_cpx and CRF86_BC) and a URF (KY406739). Additionally, three sequences
(YN34F21, YN7F27, and YN8F28) were identified as newly formed URFs, resulting
from complex recombination events between HIV subtypes B, C, and CRF01_AE.
CONCLUSION: These results underscore the continuous evolution of HIV via
recombination in the China-Myanmar border region. The identification of
second-generation recombinants and newly formed URFs highlights the importance
of continuous molecular surveillance to better understand HIV diversity and to
inform strategies for prevention, treatment, and vaccine development.

BACKGROUND: Despite advancements in HIV management, healthcare inequalities
continue to exist, especially in rural and populations vulnerable to HIV, where
factors such as distance, low income, prejudice, and a shortage of healthcare
workers contribute to delayed diagnosis and inadequate care.
OBJECTIVE: This commentary explores how telemedicine can close the healthcare
disparity gap for HIV patients in rural and vulnerable settings by bringing care
closer and decreasing stigma.
METHODS: The study analyzed primary sources, such as articles from PubMed,
Science Direct, the Web of Science, and WHO reports from 2020 to 2024, including
case studies, to examine the role of telemedicine in global HIV care. It
assessed challenges, effectiveness, and infrastructural barriers, as well as
policy implications.
RESULTS: Telemedicine in HIV care for rural and vulnerable groups includes
virtual consultation, monitoring, telehealth, digital health education,
diagnostic services, telecounselling, telemental health, telepreventive care,
and emergency services. It improves treatment involvement, reduces travel,
ensures confidentiality, and reduces social disapproval. However, internet
inefficiency and infrastructure issues in isolated regions hinder its use.
CONCLUSION: Telemedicine effectively addresses HIV care gaps in rural and
high-risk populations by increasing service utilization, reducing stigma, and
improving patient care quality; however, long-term sustainability requires
infrastructure improvements and internet connectivity issues.

Combination Antiretroviral Therapy (CART) is the mainstay in the treatment of
HIV infection. However, long-term CART causes fat redistribution, insulin
resistance, and dyslipidaemia in patients living with HIV (PLWH). There is
limited data from India that have studied these features exclusively in males.
In this cross- sectional, observational study, male PLWH (n = 29; mean age: 45.5
years) treated on CART for a decade and above were recruited by purposive
sampling method. Anthropometry and skinfold thickness were measured. Body
composition analysis was done by DXA. Surrogate indices of insulin resistance
(HOMA-IR, HOMA-Beta, and FG-IR) and insulin sensitivity (Mcauley index and
QUICKI) were calculated. At end of the study period, Zidovudine-based ART
accounted for 54.57% while Stavudine and Tenofovir based ART accounted for
28.37% and 17.05% respectively. Male PLWH on CART for more than a decade
featured increased body weight, higher body fat percentage, total body fat mass
higher abdominal adiposity and increased fat mass in upper limbs alongside,
Furthemore, reduced beta cell function, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin
resistance and lower testosterone levels were observed. The proportion of PLWH
with diabetes, prediabetes and non-diabetic individuals were (20.6% n = 6),
(34.5%; n = 10) and (44.8%: n = 13) respectively.

A critical bottleneck for equitable access to population-scale molecular
diagnostics is the limited availability of rapid, inexpensive point-of-care
tests, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Here, we developed an
open-source reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification
(RT-LAMP) molecular assay for pathogen detection. It is based on nonproprietary
enzymes, namely, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, Bst LF DNA polymerase, and UDG
BMTU thermolabile uracil-DNA glycosylase. Formulated as liquid or lyophilized
reaction mixtures, these reagents enable sensitive colorimetric detection of
respiratory samples without the need for prior nucleic acid isolation. We
evaluated our lyophilized RT-LAMP assay on clinical samples with suspected
COVID-19 infection, demonstrating high sensitivity and 100% specificity compared
with the gold-standard RT-qPCR. Reaction performance was unaffected by prolonged
storage of lyophilized reagents at ambient or elevated temperatures. As a proof
of concept, we evaluated the robustness and ease of use of lyophilized RT-LAMP
reaction mixes through independent laboratory testing of COVID-19 samples in
Ghana. Overall, our open-source RT-LAMP assay provides a flexible and scalable
point-of-care test that can be adapted for rapid detection of various pathogens
in resource-limited settings.

Natural antisense transcripts (AST) are expressed in eukaryotes, prokaryotes,
and viruses and can possess regulatory functions at the transcriptional and/or
post-transcriptional levels. In vitro studies have shown that HIV-1 AST promote
viral latency through epigenetic silencing of the proviral 5' long terminal
repeat. However, expression of AST in vivo has not been convincingly
demonstrated. Here, we used single RNA template amplification and sequencing to
demonstrate expression of AST in unstimulated PBMC collected from people with
HIV-1 (PWH). Our results show that expression levels of AST could be higher
during ART compared with untreated individuals and that clones of infected cells
persisting under ART continue to express HIV AST. This study is the first to
verify HIV-1 AST expression in vivo with sequencing, documenting AST presence
without cellular activation and suggest its natural occurrence in PWH. These
findings advance our understanding of HIV-1 persistence and underscore the need
for larger studies to determine if targeting AST in viral reservoirs could lead
to new approaches for the design of strategies towards achieving HIV remission
without ART.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare documentation completeness of HIV-related
data by age group (children, adolescents and adults) in Haiti's Electronic
Medical Record (EMR) system.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional evaluation.
SETTING: EMR data for 36 965 enrolment visits, and 123 608 return visits from 58
facilities in Haiti (from 2016 to 2022).
PARTICIPANTS: Children, adolescents and adults accessing HIV care and treatment
services in Haiti.
MAIN EXPOSURE MEASURE: Health facility attendance for HIV-related healthcare.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Level of data completeness, as a measure of data quality.
We developed Composite Completeness Scores (CCS scores) to measure data
completeness. Lower scores meant lower completeness. Generalised linear models
were used to investigate factors associated with completeness.
RESULTS: At the enrolment visit, most patients were adults (81.6%) and female
(56.7%). Most facilities were health centres (75.9%). The overall average
enrolment visit CCS score was 54.0%. At enrolment, being a child (CCS score
difference=-7.08, 95% CI: -11.31 to -2.86) and a more recent year of enrolment
(-6.01, 95% CI: -11.69 to -0.33) were significantly associated with lower
completeness scores than being an adult and having an earlier year of enrolment,
respectively. The overall average return visit CCS score was 49.6%. At the
return visit, children (-6.76, 95% CI: -10.07 to -3.45) had significantly lower
average completeness scores than adults. For first viral load documentation,
children had lower odds of completeness compared with adults (adjusted OR=0.21,
95% CI: 0.16 to 0.28). Sex, year of enrolment, facility ownership (public,
private, mixed), total patient volume and duration of EMR use were not
significantly associated with completeness of documentation at the enrolment and
return visits.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed disparities in electronic data completeness by age
group, which may be indicative of digital health disparities. Documentation was
particularly poor among children and declined over time for enrolment visits.
Further research is needed to understand and address these documentation gaps.

INTRODUCTION: Despite extensive efforts in HIV prevention, significant barriers
to accessing interventions such as HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) persist
in Canada. Although PrEP has demonstrated efficacy in preventing HIV
transmission, various structural, social and systemic factors continue to impede
its widespread adoption and use. These factors influence the uptake (acceptance
and access) and use (adherence and retention) of PrEP. The purpose of this
scoping review is to examine the existing body of evidence regarding the
barriers and facilitators to uptake and use of PrEP in Canada. By identifying
these factors, the review aims to inform future research, policy development and
interventions to improve PrEP access and its integration into HIV prevention
strategies in Canada.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review will focus on studies involving
HIV-seronegative individuals in Canada who are either eligible for or currently
using PrEP as an HIV prevention option. The review will consider barriers and
facilitators within services, programmes, policies or practices related to HIV
prevention in Canada. Eligible studies will include experimental,
quasi-experimental, observational or qualitative designs. Studies that do not
address PrEP or HIV prevention, or that involve populations not aligned with the
inclusion criteria, will be excluded. The review will involve searching a range
of key databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, CINAHL,
Scopus, Web of Science and TRIP, with no language restrictions, and focusing on
publications from 2016 onward. Two independent reviewers will screen titles and
abstracts, followed by full-text assessment and data extraction, using
Covidence. Data will be analysed narratively, with a specific focus on subgroup
analyses of key populations. The findings will be synthesised to provide an
overview of the key themes, trends, and evidence gaps identified within the
existing literature.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This piece of research will not involve human
participants and will solely use already published data. Consequently, ethics
approval is not necessary. The findings will be disseminated through
peer-reviewed journal articles and conference presentations and may be of
relevance to governmental health agencies and local HIV/AIDS service
organisations.

Despite substantial advances in biomedical HIV prevention, including long-acting
injectable pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) options such as cabotegravir,
barriers to widespread adoption and scale-up persist in low-income and
middle-income countries. Long-acting injectable lenacapavir is a potentially
transformative HIV prevention tool, providing an unprecedented opportunity to
accelerate progress. However, the global HIV response is under threat like never
before, with drastic funding cuts undermining the gains of the past 25 years.
The challenges of introducing and scaling up long-acting lenacapavir and other
PrEP innovations are numerous. Without deliberate policy, programmatic, and
financing interventions, new prevention technologies risk following slow
adoption patterns of previous innovations, weakening a needed transformation of
the HIV response. Drawing on lessons from the scale-up of antiretroviral
therapy, and experience with previous biomedical prevention tools, a new
ten-point framework should be adopted to accelerate individual and
epidemiological impact-even at this time of extraordinary uncertainty.

Sexual minority men (SMM) with HIV who use substances experience multiple forms
of stigma (e.g., experienced discrimination) related to aspects of themselves
and their behaviors and are disproportionately affected by depression. More
research is needed to examine the interrelations between multiple
discrimination, including substance-related discrimination, and depression, and
the intervening role of substance-related coping among SMM with HIV who use
drugs. Self-report data (N = 195) collected between 2017-2018 included
experienced discrimination (categories included HIV, sexual orientation,
race/ethnicity, substance use), substance-related coping, and depressive
symptoms. ANCOVA results revealed significant differences in depressive symptoms
based on the number of discrimination categories endorsed, F(6,188) = 11.71,
p < .001, with groups that endorsed discrimination across more stigmatized
categories reporting higher depressive symptoms. Supplemental ANCOVA results
also indicated differences in depressive symptoms based on endorsement of
substance use discrimination, F(4,190) = 19.16, p < .001. Analysis of indirect
associations revealed substance-related coping partially accounted for the
relation between multiple discrimination and depressive symptoms, b = 1.19,
95%CI [0.58, 1.91]. Results suggest that there is a cumulative association
between multiple discrimination and depressive symptoms, and substance-related
discrimination and substance-related coping may be particularly important
influencers on this association. Multi-level intervention efforts that target
multiple discrimination could help ameliorate the high rates of depression in

The health and nutritional status of children and their families is essential
particularly during climate change. Most of the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) affect children in some way, namely, poverty (SDG 1), hunger (SDG 2),
health (SDG 3), climate change (SDG 13). Evidence suggests that most countries
are behind in achieving the SDGs, with only 17% of the SDGs currently achieved.
The reason is because the SDGs are interconnected such that failure in one SDG,
may affect the others negatively. For example, evidence from the global north
provides many examples of the effects of climate change on other SDGs,
particularly health. Within the global south, evidence of the effects of climate
change on health is limited. This scoping review aims to document the effects of
climate change on the health and nutritional status of children and their
families in Africa. The review was conducted according to the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping
Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Three electronic databases were searched by a librarian.
One reviewer screened the articles to be included in the synthesis and a second
author went through the selected articles to confirm their inclusion. Data was
extracted and mapped according to four categories: i) climate change events or
phenomena, ii) effect of climate change on nutritional and health status, iii)
factors influencing vulnerabilities of population to climate change, iv)
interventions and innovations used to mitigate impact of climate change on
health.

BACKGROUND: People living with HIV (PLWH) who use tobacco face significant
public health risks compared to non-users, including an average loss of 12.3
years of life expectancy. Tobacco use increases the likelihood of
non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, and non-AIDS-related cancers.
AIM: This study investigated factors associated with tobacco smoking and
smokeless tobacco (SLT) use among PLWH in Zambia.
METHODS: Data were obtained from a national cross-sectional survey involving
5,204 PLWH from 193 clinics across Zambia's 10 provinces. Tobacco smoking, SLT
use, behavioral patterns, and clinical characteristics were assessed. Logistic
regression was used to determine unadjusted (UOR) and adjusted odds ratios (AOR)
at a 95% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: Among the 5,204 PLWH surveyed, 9.7% were current tobacco smokers (21.9%
men, 3.7% women), while 1.4% used smokeless tobacco (1.81% men, 1.26% women). In
the multivariable analysis, several factors were identified as predictors of
tobacco smoking. Male individuals had significantly higher odds of smoking (AOR:
4.81, 95% CI: 3.36-6.90). In contrast, higher educational attainment was
associated with lower odds of smoking (AOR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.16-0.52). Alcohol
consumption was associated with an increased likelihood of smoking (AOR: 4.97,
95% CI: 2.93-8.44). Additionally, overweight or obese individuals were less
likely to smoke, with adjusted odds ratios of 0.55 (95% CI: 0.35-0.85) and 0.36
(95% CI: 0.17-0.79), respectively. Non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART)
was also associated with higher smoking rates (AOR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.14-2.67).
Similarly, several factors were identified as predictors of smokeless tobacco
(SLT) use. Individuals with an annual income exceeding 4,000 ZMW had lower odds
of using SLT (AOR: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.14-0.73). In contrast, alcohol users
exhibited significantly higher odds of SLT use (AOR: 14.74, 95% CI:
1.99-109.02). Furthermore, non-adherence to ART was associated with an increased
likelihood of SLT use (AOR: 3.32, 95% CI: 1.54-7.17).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the urgent need for targeted interventions
to reduce tobacco use among PLWH in Zambia. Integrating these measures within
the existing healthcare framework can maximize impact. Gender-specific programs
addressing unique risk factors, alongside economic empowerment initiatives for
low-income females, could help curb SLT use. Additionally, reinforcing ART
adherence through tobacco cessation counseling within HIV care settings may
lower smoking rates. Given the strong association between alcohol consumption
and tobacco use, structured behavioral interventions and support programs should
also be prioritized. Strengthening collaborations between health authorities and
community organizations can further enhance accessibility and outreach. By
embedding these strategies within primary care and ART clinics, Zambia can
effectively reduce tobacco use among PLWH, ultimately improving overall health
outcomes and strengthening HIV management efforts.

BACKGROUND: Microalbuminuria is a critical marker for early kidney damage and a
predictor for proteinuria, a defining feature of renal disease. Its detection in
high-risk individuals is vital for reducing the risk of adverse renal outcomes,
particularly among persons living with diabetes, hypertension, and HIV. The
evaluation of microalbuminuria in high-risk individuals allows for the early
detection of renal impairment and the assessment of cardiovascular risk
profiles. Additionally, it informs targeted therapeutic interventions and
provides critical prognostic information, thereby enhancing overall clinical
outcomes. The goal of the study was to determine the prevalence and correlates
of microalbuminuria in high risk patients.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Livingstone University
Teaching Hospital (LUTH) from September 2023 to July 2024. We employed
homogeneous purposive sampling to recruit 306 high-risk adults (≥18 years) with
diabetes, hypertension, and/or HIV. Purposive sampling was employed to recruit
patients attending routine medical clinic at LUTH. Sample size was calculated
using the formula for a single proportion (expected prevalence: 30%, margin of
error: 5%, 95% CI), yielding 323; we recruited 306 due to logistical
constraints. Data were collected directly from participants as well as using
hospital records and laboratory analysis of blood/urine samples. Descriptive and
inferential statistics were analyzed using SPSS v22.
RESULTS: A total of 306 high-risk individuals were screened, with a median age
of 46 years (IQR: 31-58). Of these, 61.8% (n = 189) were females and 38.2%
(n = 117) were males. The prevalence of microalbuminuria was 28.8% (95%CI
23.7-33.8), while its prevalence among individuals with diabetes, hypertension,
and HIV was 45.4%, 33.3%, and 39.1%, respectively. Microalbuminuria was
significantly associated with diabetes (p = 0.033), individuals living with HIV
(p = 0.035), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) (p = 0.007) in
univariate analysis. On multivariable analysis, microalbuminuria was associated
with diabetes (AOR 2.90; 95% CI 1.02-8.19 p = 0.044), Living with HIV (AOR 1.96;
95%CI 1.02-3.78; p = 0.042) and Hs-CRP (AOR 1.16; 95%CI 1.02-1.30 p = 0.015).
CONCLUSION: The findings underscore the importance of routine screening for
microalbuminuria in high-risk populations. Early detection and intervention
could prevent the progression of microalbuminuria to overt renal disease,
particularly in individuals with diabetes, HIV, and systemic inflammation.
Integrating microalbuminuria screening into chronic disease management programs
is essential to mitigate renal complications in these vulnerable groups.

The genetic diversity of HIV-1, driven by mutation and recombination, poses
significant challenges to prevention and control efforts, particularly in
regions like China where multiple subtypes and circulating recombinant forms
co-circulate. Men who have sex with men (MSM) represent a key population for the
emergence of novel recombinants. This study characterizes two novel unique
recombinant forms (URFs) identified within the MSM population in Hebei, China.
Viral RNA extraction, amplification, and near full-length genome (NFLG)
sequencing were performed. Phylogenetic analysis based on NFLG alignments was
conducted in MEGA 6 under the Kimura 2-parameter model with 1,000 bootstrap
replicates. Recombination was assessed using the Recombinant Identification
Program and SimPlot v3.5.1. Breakpoint-defined regions were phylogenetically
analyzed, and recombination maps were generated. Phylogenetic and recombinant
analysis based on NFLG sequences (designated BDL061 and BDL071) revealed that
they originated from subtypes B and C. BDL061 exhibited a predominantly subtype
B backbone with interspersed subtype C segments, while BDL071 displayed a
predominantly subtype C backbone with subtype B segments. Phylogenetic analysis
of recombinant segments strongly supported (bootstrap >90%) subtype B and C
parental origins for the respective fragments. We report the identification and
characterization of two phylogenetically distinct, novel HIV-1B/C URFs (BDL061
and BDL071) among MSM in Hebei, China. Their unique mosaic structures, differing
predominant backbones, and confirmation as novel recombinants underscore the
ongoing evolution and increasing complexity of the HIV-1 epidemic within this
high-risk population in China. These findings highlight the critical need for
NFLG-based surveillance to accurately track viral diversity and inform public
health strategies.

INTRODUCTION: Older adults (defined as adults who are 50 and over) accounted for
1 in 6 persons newly diagnosed with HIV in 2022. The objectives of this analysis
were to present the most currently available data about older adults reached by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) HIV programs.
METHODS: From 2019 through 2022, CDC funded 61 health departments and 160
community-based organizations in the United States and Puerto Rico and the U.S.
Virgin Islands to provide HIV testing, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
referrals, and linkage to HIV medical care and report on their program outcomes
to CDC. We conducted descriptive analysis as well as multivariable robust
Poisson regression analysis to assess the association between demographic
characteristics and outcomes of HIV tests among older adults.
RESULTS: Between 2019 and 2022, the percentage of CDC-funded HIV tests provided
to older adults increased, (16.9% in 2019, 17.3% in 2020, 18.3% in 2021, and
18.4% in 2022). In 2022, older adults accounted for 11% of new diagnoses. Among
those, (876), 779 people had linkage data, and of those, 579 (74.1%) were linked
to HIV medical care within 30 days after diagnosis. Of those older adults with a
negative test result and available data, 90,422 (41.3%) were eligible for a PrEP
referral and 39,382 (44.3%) were referred to a PrEP provider.
DISCUSSION: Continued efforts are needed to provide focused HIV prevention
messaging specifically for older adults and to make available relevant
information about HIV to health care providers.

Black male adolescents and young adults (BMAYA) experience pronounced and
persistent sexual health disparities compared to other groups in the US. This
original research focuses on the early-stage development of The TALK, a
nurse-led multi-pronged web-based eHealth intervention to improve shared
parent-adolescent sexual health knowledge and communication. A community-engaged
approach was used to codesign the intervention with a community advisory council
and two Black-owned barbershop owners. Researchers leveraged human-centered
design process using dscout, a virtual ethnographic research tool, to examine
the usability, feasibility and acceptability of The TALK with parents of BMAYA
(n = 13). Open- and close-ended questions captured qualitative data of
end-users' experiences of and preferences for intervention technology and
content within the three primary intervention components: videos, website, and
an interactive activity. Feedback from participants on digital design,
functionality, and overall ease of use and navigation of The TALK was beneficial
for the initial intervention codesign process. Feedback was positive and
constructive, highlighting where the intervention was culturally relevant and
satisfying for users with recommendations for changes in areas of design
friction and content accessibility before efficacy and effectiveness testing.
This study helps understand how The TALK engaged participants and assisted in
parent-adolescent communication through beta testing the technological design
and content. Considering the potential for eHealth technologies in sexual health
promotion and prevention for BMAYA, thoughtful design and quality experience
should be developed early in the intervention design through human-centered
processes and community-engaged approaches.

BACKGROUND: The global HIV/AIDS epidemic, with its significant presence in
Vietnam by the early 2000s, often linked to injecting drug use, prompted concern
at the National Otorhinolaryngology Hospital due to a rising prevalence of HIV
among ENT patients. This highlighted a need to understand their specific
clinical and laboratory profiles.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically evaluate selected biochemical,
hematological, and immunological parameters in these HIV-positive ENT patients
to characterize their infection and identify significant laboratory alterations.
METHODS: This retrospective-prospective cohort study included 104 HIV-positive
ENT patients from January 2010 to August 2014. HIV diagnoses were confirmed via
a multi-test approach. Demographic, risk behavior, and ENT diagnosis data were
collected from medical records. Biochemical, hematological, and immunological
(CD4, CD8, CD4/CD8 ratio) parameters were analyzed.
RESULTS: The cohort was predominantly young adult males (85.55%), with injecting
drug use as the main risk factor (79.04%). Over half (53.60%) had HIV-related
ENT conditions; 46.40% were incidentally diagnosed. Biochemical analysis showed
significantly elevated total protein/globulin and reduced albumin/A/G ratio (p <
0.05). Hematologically, leukopenia (7.4% males) and mild/moderate anemia (20.4%
males, 33.3% females) were observed. Immunological profiling revealed
significantly decreased CD4 counts (264±89.57 cells/mm³) and CD4/CD8 ratios,
alongside increased CD8 counts (all p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: HIV-positive ENT patients in Vietnam exhibit typical
demographic/risk profiles and frequent HIV-related ENT manifestations.
Significant biochemical, hematological, and profound immunological abnormalities
underscore HIV's systemic impact. ENT clinics are crucial for early HIV
detection, necessitating comprehensive laboratory monitoring for effective
disease management.

PURPOSE: Initiating antiretroviral therapy promptly (rapid ART) is linked to
better immune recovery in people with HIV (PWH), although its specific effects
on immune dysregulation remain partially understood. We have discovered a
"pathological proliferation" phenomenon, marked by T cell over-proliferation and
exhaustion in PWH, potentially hindering full immune recovery. The objective of
this research is to examine how rapid ART affects T-cell pathological
proliferation, immune recovery, and systemic inflammation in PWH.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study (conducted at Beijing Youan
Hospital, Capital Medical University, China, from April 1 to September 18,
2022), we recruited 39 PWH, including 23 in the rapid ART group (within 30 days)
and 16 in the non-rapid ART group (after 180 days). Fasting venous blood samples
were collected in the morning. Immune phenotypes of T cells were analyzed using
mass cytometry and Luminex.
RESULTS: The rapid ART group demonstrated a significant decline in Ki67⁺ CD4⁺
and CD8⁺ T cells. Within this group, a higher percentage of naive T (TN) cells
was observed in CD4⁺ T cells, along with a remarkable reduction in Ki67
expression. Additionally, CD8⁺ T cells in the rapid ART group exhibited an
increased presence of TN cells while showing a decreased proportion of
PD-1/HLA-DR/CD38 high-expressing cells. In addition, the rapid ART group
exhibited significantly lower IL-18 levels. TN cells (CD31+ HLA-DR- CD38- CD57-
PD-1-) and central memory T (TCM) cells (HLA-DR+ CD38- PD-1- CD57-) that were
not suppressed by rapid ART showed significant correlations with baseline CD4
counts, HIV loads, and recent CD4/CD8 ratio.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest rapid ART may curb pathological T cell
proliferation and improved immune recovery in PWH. Despite these benefits,
persistent immune activation in some individuals highlights the need for
targeted immune monitoring and potential adjunctive interventions to optimize
long-term immune health in PWH.

BACKGROUND: Observational data can answer both predictive and etiologic research
questions; however, the model-building approach and interpretation of results
differ based on the research goal (i.e., prediction versus causal inference).
Conflation occurs when aspects of the methodology and/or interpretation that are
unique to prediction or etiology are combined or confused, potentially leading
to biased results and erroneous conclusions.
METHODS: We conducted a rapid review using MEDLINE (2018-2023) of a subset of
the observational TB literature: cohort studies among people with drug-resistant
TB that considered HIV status an exposure of interest and reported on TB
treatment outcomes. For each article, we assessed the research question,
statistical approach, presentation of results, and discussion and interpretation
of results.
RESULTS: Among the 40 articles included, 32 (80%) had evidence of conflation.
The most common specific types of conflation were recommending or proposing
interventions to modify exposures in a predictive study and having a causal
interpretation of predictors, with both types frequently co-occurring.
CONCLUSION: Conflation between prediction and etiology was common, highlighting
the importance of increasing awareness about it and its potential consequences.
We propose simple steps on how TB and lung health researchers can avoid
conflation, beginning with clearly defining the research question.

BACKGROUND: In Mongolia, estimated TB incidence is high, but treatment coverage
is low. Stigma is a likely barrier to access but has not previously been
evaluated.
METHODS: We conducted a national TB stigma assessment in Mongolia in 2021-2022
to evaluate prevalence and impact of TB-related stigma. All survey participants
had face-to-face interviews conducted by trained community staff members using
semi-structured questionnaires tailored to study participants.
RESULTS: Study participants included 460 people with TB, 90 family members, 83
community members and 115 healthcare workers (HCWs). Overall, 53% of
participants reported experiencing stigma with HCWs reporting highest prevalence
(72%). Stigma was most commonly experienced in healthcare settings, particularly
during initial diagnosis and treatment initiation. Urban slum residence was
associated with higher stigma among patients while older age was associated with
lower scores. Female respondents reported stigma significantly more commonly
overall. Family members and community members commonly reported secondary stigma
with concerns about infection and social isolation being prevalent.
CONCLUSION: TB-related stigma is highly prevalent across Mongolia. There is an

BACKGROUND: Adolescents and young adults with HIV (AYAWH) represent vulnerable
populations, with increased risk of virologic failure, loss to follow-up, and
death. Depression and substance use in AYAWH can lead to worse outcomes, yet
this overlap is not well understood.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included adolescents (10-17 years) and young
adults (18-24 years) with HIV in the Caribbean, Central and South America
network for HIV epidemiology (CCASAnet). Participants were administered surveys
to assess for depression, substance use, and antiretroviral therapy (ART)
adherence. Risk factors for depression; alcohol, tobacco, and substance use;
missing ART doses; viral suppression; and 1-year retention were assessed.
RESULTS: Six hundred twenty-five AYAWH were included. Depression prevelance was
16%. Males (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.26; 95% CI, 0.16-0.44) and younger
youth (15-year-olds vs 18-year-olds: aOR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40-0.95) were less
likely to have depression. Fifty-eight percent reported using alcohol, 28%
reported tobacco use, 17% reported cannabis use, and 4% reported cocaine use.
Forty-one percent missed 1 or more doses of ART in the past week. Forty percent
had detectable viral loads at the time of survey completion. Those who acquired
HIV perinatally were more likely to have an unsuppressed viral load (aOR, 2.4;
95% CI, 1.24-4.62; P = .009). Only 73% of participants were retained in care
following the survey; there was no statistical association between retention and
age, sex, education, probable route of HIV acquisition, depression, and needing
intervention for substance use.
CONCLUSIONS: Substance use and depression were prevalent in AYAWH, as were
missed doses of ART and detectable viral loads.

OBJECTIVE: Meningitis is one of the most severe manifestations of fungal
infections in the central nervous system. Various microorganisms, including
fungi, can cause the disease. Understanding the prevalence of fungal meningitis
is crucial for identifying geographical areas with higher incidence rates and
improving prevention, control, and treatment strategies. This study aimed to
highlight gaps in understanding disease-causing factors and vulnerable
populations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to systematically
review articles on fungal meningitis from 2014 to 2023. Relevant articles were
screened for eligibility and quality-checked using the Joanna Briggs Institute
(JBI) tools before inclusion in the final analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 33 articles were included in the review. Most of the
articles on the prevalence of fungal meningitis were published in 2015. The
highest number of studies were conducted in the United States, southern African
countries, and Brazil. Cryptococcus spp. was identified as the primary cause of
fungal meningitis in 84.8% of the articles. Additionally, HIV was the most
commonly associated medical condition.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review provides an overview of the global
epidemiology of fungal meningitis and underscores its significant burden. While
progress has been made in understanding the epidemiology of the disease, major
challenges remain in early diagnosis, access to effective treatment, and
management of complications. Continued research and improved access to
healthcare resources are critical to mitigating the impact of this
life-threatening condition worldwide.

Managing the mpox in patients with advanced HIV infection and coinfections poses
significant challenges. This report discusses a young male with advanced HIV
(CD4 count 28) and severe concurrent mpox and HSV-1 proctitis. Despite initial
treatment with oral tecovirimat, acyclovir, and antiretrovirals, the patient's
condition worsened, requiring readmission. The patient received intravenous
tecovirimat, vaccinia immune globulin, and brincidofovir. Sigmoidoscopy revealed
extensive rectal and sigmoid lesions that necessitated prolonged hospitalization
and pain management. This case emphasizes the complexity of treating severe
coinfections in immunocompromised patients, highlighting the need for a
multidisciplinary approach and consideration of alternative therapies when
standard treatment fails.

Emerging evidence from the REPRIEVE study cohort has further clarified the
association between abacavir use and cardiovascular risk. This analysis, along
with previous findings, demonstrates a significant elevation in time to first
major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among adults living with HIV with
current or past abacavir exposure. Given the availability of safer, equally
effective alternative ART regimens with fewer cardiovascular risks, the
continued clinical relevance of abacavir in adults living with HIV should be
critically reassessed. Considering these findings, abacavir should be considered
an obsolete option for most, if not all, adults living with HIV. This
perspective shift emphasizes the importance of selecting ART regimens that
optimize long-term cardiovascular health while achieving durable virologic
suppression in the modern era of HIV treatment.

BACKGROUND: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a highly
aggressive extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Moreover, there is currently no
specific prognostic model for elderly PCNSL patients.
METHODS: This study retrospectively selected patients diagnosed with PCNSL
between 1975 and 2016 from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results Database (SEER NCI). The COX model was used to
determine the risk factors for overall survival (OS) and disease-specific
survival (DSS). The prognostic prediction models for DSS and OS were developed
by integrating significant covariates identified through multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 3,554 patients with PCNSL were included in this
retrospective study based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Significant
differences exist in clinical profiles between elderly (≥60 years) and younger
(<60 years) patients with PCNSL. The results showed that the age at diagnosis,
pathological subtype, whether or not they have undergone surgical treatment, and
whether or not they have received chemotherapy are independent risk factors for
DSS, among elderly PCNSL patients. In addition to the risk factors, etc for DSS,
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was also an independent risk factor
for OS. Based on this, we developed nomograms to estimate OS and DSS for 1, 2,
and 3 years.
CONCLUSION: This study found differences in baseline data between elderly PCNSL
patients and younger PCNSL patients. Surgery and chemotherapy are associated
with better OS and DSS. However, in the long run, radiotherapy is not beneficial
to OS and DSS of elderly PCNSL patients.

INTRODUCTION: Umbilical cord blood (UCB) units are an alternative valuable
source for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells (allo-HSCT). Patients undergoing
allo-HSCT remain at high risk for complications and mortality due to viral
infections such as human adenovirus (HAdV). HAdV, a double-stranded DNA virus,
has been detected in the full-term placenta, raising concerns about vertical
transmission. This study aims to examine the presence of HAdV in UCB samples to
improve the safety of transplantation procedures. Methods: A total of 98 UCB
plasma samples were assayed to detect the presence of HAdV DNA using real-time
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology Results: Of the 98 UCB plasma samples
analyzed for HAdV, three tested positive (3.06%). In control testing for
prevalent pathogens, 67.3% of the samples were Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
IgG-positive (indicating past infection) and 4.2% were CMV IgM-positive (recent
or active infection). All the samples were negative for human T-lymphotropic
virus I-II (HTLV_I-II), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg), and human immunodeficiency virus I-II (HIV_I-II).
CONCLUSIONS: The detection of HAdV in a subset of UCB samples highlights the
need to consider molecular screening for HAdV as part of routine safety
evaluations in allogeneic UCB transplantation.

Long COVID, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), and
other poorly understood post-acute infection syndromes (PAIS) can present with
unexplained symptoms or conditions that may be misunderstood by healthcare
providers, causing delays in diagnosis and care. To address these issues, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funded the Long COVID and
Fatiguing Illness Recovery Program (LC&FIRP), initiated as a pilot project to
assess whether providing tele-mentoring and other online education for primary
care providers could help them improve the quality of life and support the
recovery of their patients with these conditions. The LC&FIRP multi-disciplinary
team-based care approach is built on the Extension for Community Healthcare
Outcomes (ECHO) learning model, which is an evidence-based virtual learning
framework developed by the University of New Mexico and designed to disseminate
and implement best practices, especially in under-resourced areas. A distinctive
feature of LC&FIRP was the inclusion of lived-experience experts. To explore the
influence of lived-experience experts on the care patients received, we
collected the educational recommendations provided by the lived-experience
experts during webinar sessions (January 2022-March 2024) and grouped these by
themes. The major themes that emerged included validation of patients' illness
experience; attitudes and beliefs about Long COVID, ME/CFS, and PAIS;
understanding patients' challenges and communicating with empathy; navigating
referrals; recognizing and supporting disability; and supporting self-care.
Investigators also interviewed patients of the Family Health Centers of San
Diego (FHCSD) about their experiences receiving care from participating primary
care providers and employed content analysis methods to code interview
transcripts to identify themes among patients' perspectives. Positive comments
from the patients about topics emphasized by the lived-experience experts
provided evidence of providers' uptake and application of the experts'
recommendations and support the value of involving lived-experience experts in
medical education to improve health services.

Since its identification in 1981, HIV has posed a global public health
challenge, witnessing transformative advancements in treatment and prevention.
This review summarizes recent novel therapeutic and preventive approaches for
long-term HIV control, management, and elimination, and how global collaboration
and technological innovations may advance HIV control efforts. This study
highlights the progress and challenges in HIV treatment, emphasizing the
effectiveness of current antiretroviral therapy (ART) in suppressing viral
replication, reducing transmission, and preventing end-organ damage. However,
adherence remains a significant barrier due to pill burden, side effects, and
psychosocial factors affecting patients. ART-related toxicities include
neuropathy, hepatotoxicity, metabolic disorders, and neuropsychiatric effects.
Long-acting ART (LA-ART) offers a promising alternative to daily dosing;
however, challenges such as injection site reactions persist. Broadly
neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) have shown enhanced efficacy in viral
suppression and immune response activation, offering potential for treatment and
vaccine design. Innovative gene-editing tools, such as CRISPR-Cas systems, are
being explored for their ability to excise or silence proviral DNA; however,
their clinical application is limited by off-target effects and delivery
challenges. Latency-targeting strategies like "shock and kill" and "block and
lock" remain experimental with limited clinical success, and
nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems offer targeted, sustained, and less
toxic treatment options. Despite the challenges posed by the virus's rapid
mutation rate and immune evasion mechanisms, novel vaccine approaches, such as
mRNA technology, vector-based platforms, and epitope-targeting strategies, are
being explored. In addition, artificial intelligence and machine learning are
enhancing the design of vaccines, predictive modeling, and fast-tracking
progress in this area. Socio-economic bottlenecks in HIV control, such as
stigma, gender disparities, and inequitable healthcare access, exacerbate the
epidemic, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Enhancing global collaboration,
providing sustainable funding, and integrating emerging and innovative
technologies are critical for advancing HIV prevention and management. Achieving
an AIDS-free generation and ultimately eliminating the epidemic will depend on
effectively addressing the social, structural, and scientific barriers that
hinder progress in this regard. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov

We present a case of a 54-year-old male, with newly detected HIV with low CD4
counts, diagnosed with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis secondary to
disseminated histoplasmosis. The history of his high-risk sexual behavior,
fever, and pancytopenia led to clinical suspicion of HIV which was confirmed on
serology. Hemophagocytosis was detected on bone marrow aspiration cytology and
histoplasmosis was diagnosed on ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration
cytology of cervical lymph nodes. Timely interference of antiretroviral therapy
(ART), antifungals, and identification of HLH lead to recovery of the patient.

INTRODUCTION: Comorbidities of HIV/AIDS and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are
increasingly prevalent, affecting up to 30% of individuals living with HIV/AIDS,
particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Conventional approaches that treat NCDs
separately from HIV/AIDS care have been deemed inefficient, highlighting the
need for integrated models. This study aims to develop a framework for
integrating NCD care into HIV programs at primary healthcare facilities in
Southern Africa.
METHODS: As part of a broader study examining the burden, extent and cost of
HIV/NCD integration we employed a modified 'Best fit' framework synthesis
method. Thematic analysis was the primary method of analysis used to inform the
framework.
RESULTS: The study expanded on existing framework themes related to effective
team-working, organizational leadership, patient-centered care,
community/patient/provider partnerships. It introduced seven additional themes:
country specific NCD prioritization, multi stakeholder partnerships, healthcare
worker mental wellbeing, unified health information systems, with enhanced
privacy, establishing costing databases for HIV/NCD integrated care, robust
monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, and opportunities for regional
coordination.
CONCLUSION: Improving existing frameworks for integrating HIV/NCD care is
feasible by leveraging established HIV care platforms. These enhancements can
support more efficient holistic healthcare delivery across primary healthcare
facilities in Southern Africa.
