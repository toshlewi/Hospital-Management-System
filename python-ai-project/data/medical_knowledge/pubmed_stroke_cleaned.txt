OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) in
improving neurological function and short-term prognosis in patients with acute
ischemic stroke (AIS).
METHODS: This randomized, controlled, single-blind study aimed to evaluate the
short-term (7-day) effects of RIC on neurological function in patients with AIS.
264 AIS patients (median age 65 years, 63.3% male) with ischemic symptoms <72 h
post-onset were randomly assigned to either the RIC group (n = 65) or the
control group (n = 199). RIC was administered manually using a cuff
sphygmomanometer, while the control group received a sham RIC treatment.
Patients with cardioembolic sources or a history of prior stroke were excluded
from the study. Primary outcomes were the proportion of patients with an mRS
score of ≤2 at 7 days, as well as changes in the National Institutes of Health
Stroke Scale (NIHSS), modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Activities of Daily Living
(ADL), and Rancho Los Amigos (RLA) scores. Data were collected at baseline and
7 days post-enrollment, with in-person follow-up visits conducted by blinded
clinicians.
RESULTS: At 7 days, the RIC group showed a significantly higher proportion of
patients with an mRS score of ≤2 compared to the control group (41.5% vs. 28.1%,
p = 0.043). Significant improvements were observed in the RIC group compared to
the control group in NIHSS (p = 0.004) and ADL scores (p = 0.005), but not in
RLA scores (p > 0.05). Binary Logistic Regression Analysis indicated that, after
adjusting for baseline factors, the treatment effect of RIC remained
statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: RIC treatment enhances neurological function and improves short-term
prognosis in AIS patients. These findings support the potential clinical
application of RIC in AIS management.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Serum ferritin, a well-established biomarker of iron
status, has been inconsistently linked to stroke risk in previous studies. This
meta-analysis aims to systematically evaluate the association between serum
ferritin levels and the risk of stroke.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search across the PubMed and
Embase databases to identify relevant studies. Studies meeting predefined
eligibility criteria were selected, and relevant data were extracted.
Statistical analysis was performed using Stata 12.0.
RESULTS: Ten studies, including eight longitudinal and three cross-sectional,
were included in our meta-analysis. Cross-sectional studies showed that stroke
patients had significantly higher serum ferritin levels than controls.
Longitudinal studies suggested a 22% increase in stroke risk in individuals with
higher serum ferritin. Subgroup analysis indicated that further high-quality
population-based cohort studies are warranted to validate these findings.
Dose-response meta-analysis confirmed a positive association between serum
ferritin levels and stroke risk.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis provides evidence of a positive association
between increased serum ferritin levels and stroke incidence. While these
results are promising, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn at this time.
Therefore, additional robust, prospective cohort studies are imperative to
substantiate this relationship.

BACKGROUND: For patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) admitted to primary
stroke centers (PSC) without neuro-interventional capabilities, timely transfer
to comprehensive stroke centers (CSC) is crucial. In this study, we compared the
transport time of ground- and air-based transfer for patients receiving
endovascular treatment at our CSC.
METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, consecutive ischemic stroke patients
with LVO who were transferred ground- or air-based to our CSC between October
2018 and December 2022 were examined. 170 patients with LVO from five PSCs
within a radius of 55 to 85 km to the CSC were included. Patients were
transported either with an emergency rescue helicopter (ERH), a ground ambulance
(GA), GA accompanied by an emergency physician vehicle (EPV), or in a mobile
intensive care unit (MICU) and were accordingly divided into air-based (61
patients) and ground-based (109 patients) main transport groups.
RESULTS: The analysis revealed a significant difference between air- and
ground-based transport groups (75 vs. 82 min, p = 0.01). After calculating the
transport time in relation to the covered ground distance, air-based transport
was shorter by a median of 0.15 min per kilometer. In a comparison of the
individual means, ERH was faster than GA and EPV (both p < 0.001). Only few
transports were done by MICU and they mainly showed very long transfer times.
The complication rates were generally low with only minor complications and no
deaths reported in both groups. However, they were more frequently observed in
the land-based transport group (20.2% vs. 8.2%, p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: In the present analysis, air-based transport was faster than
ground-based transport for the secondary transfer of patients with stroke due to
LVO in the observed regional conditions. Both air- and land-based transport
appear to be safe. No serious complications occurred during transport, while
complications were more frequent in the ground-based transport group.

OBJECTIVE: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a known risk factor for stroke, but its
impact on prognosis after intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in acute ischemic
stroke (AIS) remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the association
between MetS and prognosis in AIS patients treated with IVT.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study including AIS patients who
received IVT at Shanxi Bethune Hospital between January 2022 and December 2023.
Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to balance baseline characteristics
between MetS and non-MetS groups. The primary outcome was 3-month all-cause
mortality. Secondary outcomes included good functional outcome (modified Rankin
Scale [mRS] 0-2) and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH).
RESULTS: After PSM, 292 patients (146 pairs) were enrolled in the analysis. The
all-cause mortality rate within 3 months was significantly higher in the MetS
group compared to the non-MetS group (24.0% vs. 11.6%; p < 0.01). Multivariate
Cox regression analysis indicated that MetS was independently associated with
increased 3-month mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 2.50, 95% CI:
1.35-4.60; p < 0.01). A dose-response relationship was observed between the
number of MetS components and mortality. Additionally, patients with MetS were
less likely to achieve good functional outcomes (adjusted odds ratio
[OR] = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.28-0.77; p < 0.01) and had a higher risk of SICH
(adjusted OR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.17-4.92; p = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: MetS is an independent predictor of increased mortality, poorer
functional recovery, and higher risk of SICH in AIS patients treated with IVT.
Early identification and management of metabolic risk factors may improve
outcomes in this population.

Association between triglyceride glucose-waist-adjusted waist index and incident
stroke in Chinese adults: a prospective cohort study.
Ye Y(1), He Z(1), Wu J(1), Wu J(1), Liang Y(1).
(1)Department of General Practice Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun
Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.
OBJECTIVE: Current literature lacks evidence on the association between the
triglyceride glucose-weight-adjusted waist index (TyG-WWI) and incident stroke.
Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the relationship between TyG-WWI and
stroke risk in a nationally representative cohort of middle-aged and elderly
Chinese adults by: (1) Quantitatively assessing its prospective association with
incident stroke, and (2) Investigating potential nonlinear relationships and
inflection points.
METHODS: This national longitudinal study examined data from five waves of the
CHARLS (2011-2020). TyG-WWI served as the key exposure variable, while stroke
incidence, as determined by physician diagnosis, was the principal outcome of
interest. Associations were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models
alongside nonlinear analyses, with careful adjustment for a range of covariates.
To further ensure the reliability of our findings, we performed a series of
sensitivity and subgroup analyses.
RESULTS: In this study, we investigated the association between TyG-WWI and
stroke risk. The results demonstrated a significant positive correlation between
TyG-WWI quartiles and stroke risk, with HRs of 1.35 (95% CI 1.08-1.69,
p = 0.0094), 1.38 (95% CI 1.09-1.73, p = 0.0069), and 1.42 (95% CI 1.09-1.85,
p = 0.0086) for Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively, compared to Q1 in Model III (P for
trend = 0.0158). A two-piecewise linear regression model revealed an inflection
point of TyG-WWI at 43.32, with a significant association between TyG-WWI and
stroke risk only above this point (HR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05, p = 0.0008).
Stratified analysis indicated a more robust association in non-hypertensive
individuals (HR = 1.94, 95% CI 1.29-2.91, p = 0.0014 in Q4) and a significant
interaction for hypertension status (P for interaction = 0.0493).
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study reveals a significant association between
TyG-WWI and stroke risk in the middle-aged and elderly population in China, with
stroke risk increasing progressively across higher TyG-WWI quartiles. Notably,
this association was significantly more pronounced in non-hypertensive
individuals. Furthermore, an inflection point indicates a stronger association
beyond this threshold.

How does academic self-efficacy influence learning anxiety and academic burnout
in Chinese characters learning among international students in China?
Lin Y(1).

Xi'an, China.
BACKGROUND: The interplay between learning self-efficacy, anxiety, and burnout
has been extensively documented in English as a Second Language (ESL) education.
However, Chinese character learning-a uniquely complex task involving
visual-spatial processing, stroke order mastery, and radical
decomposition-presents distinct cognitive and affective challenges. The dynamics
of self-efficacy, anxiety, and burnout in Chinese character acquisition remain
under-explored, creating a critical gap in understanding how these constructs
operate in non-alphabetic language contexts.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate how learning anxiety
(LA) affects academic burnout (AB) and explores the role of academic
self-efficacy (ASE) in the relationship between the two.
METHODS: A study of 537 international students (50.4% males, mean
age = 20.96 years, SD = 1.36) was conducted using the Academic Self-Efficacy
Scale (ASES), Foreign Language Learning Anxiety Scale (FLLAS), Academic Burnout
Scale (ABS).
RESULTS: ① LA was significantly and positively correlated with AB, and
significantly and negatively correlated with ASE. ② ASE mediated the
relationship between LA and AB. ③ Grade level, sleep quality, and parental
education level have a significant effect on ASE, LA and AB; and ④ Extroversion
has a significant effect on ASE, but not on LA and AB.
CONCLUSION: The chain mediation model validated by this study provides valuable
insights into the effects of international students' learning anxiety (LA) on
academic burnout (AB) in China, alongside practical implications for preventing
and intervening in LA and AB among other current students.

EF-G Mutations Reveal Correlation between Power Stroke and Translocation
Fidelity in Protein Synthesis.
Chen Y, Steele JH, Xu S, Wang Y.
The ribosome translocates on the mRNA by primarily three nucleotides per step
during protein synthesis, a process catalyzed by elongation factor G (EF-G). The
large conformational changes of EF-G in this process generate significant
mechanical force, referred to as power stroke. Quantification of power stroke
remains under debate and its potential correlation with translocation fidelity
has not been observed. In this work, we present a unique application of quantum
sensing in combined measurements of the power strokes of mutated EF-G and their
influence on ribosome translocation steps. Two EF-G mutants, H584K and Q508K,
were expressed, with the mutated residues directly interacting with tRNA. H584K,
which interacts on codon-anticodon minihelix, produced a much reduced power
stroke of 60 ± 6 pN and induced -1 frameshifting, wherein the ribosome
translocated only two nucleotides on both sides of the mRNA. In contrast, Q508K,
which interacts with tRNA residue 37 immediately outside the codon-anticodon
minihelix, exhibited a power stroke of 89 ± 11 pN and maintained canonical 3-nt
translocation, similar to wild-type EF-G. These findings provide direct
mechanistic evidence that the pivotal point and force projection exerted by EF-G
are critical for maintaining translocation fidelity, likely via lowering the
kinetic energy barrier.

M, Lupu C, Humphries K, Simmons JH, Lupu F.
Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SIC) significantly contributes to sepsis-related
morbidity and mortality, necessitating a deeper understanding of its mechanisms.
This study used a post-hoc, multimodal approach-including single-nucleus RNA
sequencing (snRNA-seq), echocardiography, mitochondrial function, and
histopathology-to characterize SIC in a non-human primate model. Archived data
and samples from six baboons challenged with 37.5 mg/kg of purified
peptidoglycan were analyzed. Vital signs and echocardiography were monitored for
8 hours; the endpoint was survival at 168 hours or euthanasia for irreversible
organ failure. Septic shock-defined by hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated
lactate-was associated with poor outcomes. Echocardiography showed reduced
intravascular volume, contraction, stroke volume, and cardiac index. SnRNA-seq
revealed distinct transcriptomic profiles: non-survivors exhibited inflammation,
mitochondrial dysfunction, and maladaptive remodeling; survivors showed
activation of pathways supporting contraction, metabolism, and repair. Cell-type
analysis highlighted metabolic dysfunction in cardiomyocytes, TNF/NF-κB-driven
inflammation in endothelial cells, and stress responses in fibroblasts and
pericytes. Mitochondrial analysis showed impaired electron transport and
disrupted metabolism. Histopathology revealed inflammation and myofibrillar
damage, more severe in non-survivors. This model recapitulates key SIC features
and supports mechanistic and therapeutic discovery.

Competition between tool and hand motion impairs movement planning in limb
apraxia.
Thibault S, Yates JB, Buxbaum LJ, Wong AL.
Tool use is a complex motor planning problem. Prior research suggests that
planning to use tools involves resolving competition between different
tool-related action representations. We therefore reasoned that competition may
also be exacerbated with tools for which the motions of the tool and the hand
are incongruent (e.g., pinching the fingers to open a clothespin). If this
hypothesis is correct, we should observe marked deficits in planning the use of
incongruent as compared to congruent tools in individuals with limb apraxia
following left-hemisphere stroke (LCVA), a disorder associated with abnormal
action competition. We asked 34 individuals with chronic LCVA (14 females) and
16 matched neurotypical controls (8 females) to use novel tools in which the
correspondence between the motions of the hand and tool-tip were either
congruent or incongruent. Individuals with LCVA also completed background
assessments to quantify apraxia severity. We observed increased planning time
for incongruent as compared to congruent tools as a function of apraxia
severity. Further analysis revealed that this impairment predominantly occurred
early in the task when the tools were first introduced. Lesion-symptom mapping
analyses revealed that lesions to posterior temporal and inferior parietal areas
were associated with impaired planning for incongruent tools. A second
experiment on the same individuals with LCVA revealed that the ability to
gesture the use of conventional tools was impaired for tools rated as more
incongruent by a normative sample. These findings suggest that tool-hand
incongruence evokes action competition and influences the tool-use difficulties
experienced by people with apraxia.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Prior research indicates that competition between
different representations associated with moving or using tools must be resolved
to enable tool use. We demonstrated that competition may be exacerbated when
tool and hand motions are incongruent (e.g., pinching the hand opens a
clothespin), resulting in tool-use impairments particularly for individuals with
greater severity of limb apraxia, a disorder known to be associated with action
competition abnormalities. Lesions in posterior portions of the brain's tool use
network were associated with impairments in planning incongruent tool actions.
This study thus demonstrates that tool-hand incongruence may invoke competition
between motions of the hand and tool-tip, which individuals with limb apraxia
have difficulty resolving to properly use tools.

Luminal Vascular Dysfunction Drives Rapid Blood Brain Barrier Injury in
Hyperglycemic Stroke: Key Roles for Luminal Glycocalyx and Complement.
Chen H, Frank JA, Tan C, Lee AG, Kopchock R, Chiang T, Kim A, Galvan M, Fraser
JF, Dornbos D, Aboul-Nour H, Millson N, Tomlinson S, McCullough LD, Pennypacker
K, Cheng MY, Bliss TM, Steinberg GK.
BACKGROUND: Acute hyperglycemia affects approximately 40% of stroke patients and
is associated with worse outcomes. The underlying mechanisms linking this
metabolic stress to stroke-induced brain injury remains unclear, and effective
therapies are lacking.
METHODS: In a mouse model of acute hyperglycemic stroke, luminal disruption,
blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage, neurological deficit, motor function, and
mortality were evaluated. Vascular luminal glycocalyx and complement activation
were assessed by immunostaining, with glycocalyx loss confirmed by electron
microscopy. Complement C3's causal role was tested using C3 knockout mice and
site-targeted inhibition with CR2-Crry. To enhance translational relevance,
post-mortem human stroke and control brains were immunostained to assess the
association between endothelial glycocalyx loss and vascular complement
activation. In a separate stroke patient cohort, soluble complement activation
products were measured in pre-thrombectomy plasma, and their predictive value
for modified Rankin Scale (mRS) outcomes evaluated using elastic net regression.
RESULTS: Hyperglycemic stroke mice exhibited accelerated and more severe BBB
breakdown, greater functional deficits, and higher mortality than normoglycemic
controls, mirroring clinical observations. Acute hyperglycemia triggered rapid
vascular luminal injury characterized by loss of endothelial luminal glycocalyx,
luminal IgM/IgG deposition, and vascular complement C3 activation, leading to
BBB disruption. This vascular luminal injury was corroborated in human stroke
brain tissue. These luminal changes persisted despite glucose normalization and
were exacerbated by reperfusion, driving injury into the brain parenchyma.
Genetic and pharmacological approaches confirmed vascular complement activation
as a causal driver of severe BBB disruption and poor outcomes. Importantly,
site-targeted pharmacological inhibition of complement after reperfusion
preserved BBB integrity and improved outcomes, defining a time-specific,
luminal-directed strategy as a promising adjunct to thrombectomy. Notably,
soluble complement activation markers in pre-thrombectomy stroke plasma
predicted clinical outcomes, highlighting their potential as pre-intervention
markers for patient stratification and tailored therapy.
CONCLUSION: This study reframes acute hyperglycemic stroke as a vascular luminal
disorder, establishing a novel Metabolic-Complement-Vascular (MCV) axis linking
metabolic stress to endothelial luminal glycocalyx loss, vascular complement
activation, and BBB breakdown in both mice and humans. This new mechanistic
understanding transforms the therapeutic landscape of hyperglycemic stroke,
offering a potential time-defined, luminal-focused adjunct therapy alongside
thrombectomy.
CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE: What Is New?: - This study reframes hyperglycemic stroke
as an acute vascular luminal problem, marked by rapid loss of endothelial
luminal glycocalyx and complement C3 activation at the vascular luminal surface.
- The rapid luminal changes, identified in both rodent and human stroke brain
tissues, establish a novel Metabolic-Complement-Vascular (MCV) axis linking
metabolic stress to luminal damage, blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, and
injury progression into the brain parenchyma. - The first clinical evidence that
pre-thrombectomy plasma complement activation markers independently predict
stroke outcomes - laying the foundation for risk stratification before
reperfusion and precision adjunct therapies.What Are the Clinical Implications?:
- The rapidity and persistence of the MCV axis activation-even after glucose
normalization-help explain the limited efficacy of insulin therapy, shifting the
therapeutic focus from glycemic control to luminal-targeted interventions.-
Identification of a narrow but actionable window following reperfusion where
complement C3 inhibition preserves the BBB and limits injury progression to the
parenchyma, offers a promising adjunct to thrombectomy in metabolically
vulnerable stroke patients.- Targeting the vascular luminal surface reshapes the
therapeutic landscape for hyperglycemic stroke by enabling systemic
interventions-bypassing the challenge of BBB penetration, supporting rapid
clinical translation using existing FDA-approved C3 inhibitors, and framing the
endothelial glycocalyx as a promising area for therapeutic and diagnostic
exploration in hyperglycemic stroke and broader cerebrovascular disease.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus,
presents not only as a respiratory ailment but also poses risks of neurological
complications whose underlying mechanisms remain unclear. These complications
range from mild to severe and may involve direct invasion of the central nervous
system (CNS), disruption of the blood-brain barrier, or systemic cytokine
effects. Diagnostic challenges persist due to the suboptimal sensitivity of
RT-PCR assays.
OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to review the contrast and non-contrast
enhanced cranial CT images of all diagnosed COVID-19 patients in a tertiary
referral center with the clinical impression of non-traumatic and nonoperative
CNS pathologies.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study analyzing CT images of COVID-19
patients with neurological symptoms. Among 51 included patients, plain CT scans
were predominantly used, revealing no acute infarcts or hemorrhages in the
majority, while frontal lobe involvement was notable in cases with pathology.
Chronic infarcts or ischemic changes were observed in over half of the cases,
primarily affecting the anterior circulation. Only one case of meningitis was
documented.
RESULTS: In the final analysis, 51 patients met the inclusion criteria out of
the initial 64 enrolled. The study population, predominantly male with a mean
age of 58.02 ± 20.87 years, mainly comprised patients solely diagnosed with
COVID-19. Plain CT scans were favored over contrast-enhanced scans (76.50%, n =
39). While most patients had no acute infarcts or hemorrhages, the frontal lobe
was commonly affected among stroke patients (9.8%, n = 5). Additionally, a
significant portion of patients without acute stroke findings exhibited chronic
infarcts or ischemic changes (57.69%, n = 15).
CONCLUSIONS: This study sheds light on the radiological patterns of CNS
involvement in COVID-19 patients, highlighting frequent frontal lobe involvement
possibly attributed to hypercoagulability and endotheliitis. Further research
with larger sample sizes and MRI utilization is recommended to enhance our
understanding of CNS manifestations in COVID-19. This study contributes to
understanding COVID-19 neurological sequelae, particularly in terms of
radiological patterns, among patients presenting with neurological symptoms. The
findings highlight the need for comprehensive evaluation and management of
neurological complications in COVID-19 patients.

As an inflammatory disease, atherosclerosis is associated with acute ischemic
stroke (AIS), but its early identification and intervention efficacy remain
suboptimal. A new research direction may be to explore peripheral
atherosclerotic biomarkers from the perspective of mitochondrial dysfunction,
which can induce inflammatory cell activation. Moreover, the degree of overall
cervicocephalic atherosclerosis (namely, atherosclerotic burden) is more closely
related to AIS prognosis than local atherosclerotic lesions. Therefore, this
study investigated the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), including monocytes and lymphocytes,
and overall cervicocephalic atherosclerotic burden and AIS outcome. Patients
with AIS and cervicocephalic atherosclerosis were enrolled and followed up for
90 days. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the mitochondrial
deoxyribonucleic acid copy number (mtDNA-CN) in PBMCs were measured respectively
through a fluorescence probe and a droplet digital polymerase chain reaction to
evaluate mitochondrial function. The overall intracranial and cervical
atherosclerotic burden (ICAB) was quantified by summing up the atherosclerosis
degree points in each arterial segment as assessed by computed tomography
angiography. A modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score >2 was considered a 90-day
unfavorable functional outcome. Five (4.9%) of the 103 patients with AIS were
lost to follow-up. mtDNA-CN [adjusted β = -0.099, 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
= -0.153 ∼ -0.044, p < 0.001] and ROS content (adjusted β = 1.275, 95%CI = 0.885
∼ 1.665, p < 0.001) were correlated with ICAB. The risk of a 90-day unfavorable
functional outcome increased with higher ROS content [adjusted odds ratio (OR) =
1.523, 95%CI = 1.172 ∼ 1.981, p = 0.002] and decreased with higher mtDNA-CN
(adjusted OR = 0.911, 95%CI = 0.850 ∼ 0.976, p = 0.008). PBMC mitochondrial
dysfunction was found to be independently associated with extensive and severe
cervicocephalic atherosclerosis and a 90-day unfavorable functional outcome in
patients with AIS, which may provide a novel approach to improving the early
identification and risk stratification of cervicocephalic atherosclerosis, along
with the prediction of the outcome of atherosclerotic AIS.

BACKGROUND: Within the dual stream model for language, the bilateral dorsal
superior temporal gyrus (STG) is associated with spectro-temporal analysis while
the mid-post superior temporal sulcus is associated with processing of
higher-level phonological codes. However, the true lateralization of functions
needed for phonological discrimination at the word level remains unsettled. The
aim of the present work was to determine if individuals with acute stroke
primarily involving the left STG and middle temporal gyrus (MTG) demonstrated
poorer discrimination (d') between phonologically related words in a
word-picture verification task than those with left hemisphere lesions outside
the temporal lobe and compared to those with right hemisphere stroke. The latter
would support a left bias and provide an estimate of the magnitude.
METHODS: One hundred fourteen individuals with acute stroke completed both acute
magnetic resonance imaging and a word-picture verification task with
phonological and semantic foils. Eighty-nine participants had left hemisphere
stroke (51 included the temporal lobe). Twenty participants had right hemisphere
stroke (14 included the temporal lobe). Five participants with bilateral stroke
were included (3 included the bilateral temporal lobes). Quantile regression was
performed controlling for overall lesion volume, age, and sex.
RESULTS: While more than half of patients performed the task well, patients with
left temporal lobe lesions were more likely to perform poorly.
CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm a role for the left superior temporal lobe,
including the STG, in phonological processing during word recognition, and
indicate that a subset of individuals (<50%) have varying degrees of left bias
in discrimination of phonologically similar words in the STG.

PURPOSE: Progressive cognitive disorders are not always caused primarily by
neurodegenerative diseases. This case report emphasizes the importance of taking
rare metabolic disorders into consideration in the differential diagnosis in
patients of all ages. It also shows the possible risk of corticosteroids in the
treatment of unexplained neurological symptoms.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We report on the case of a 60-year-old female who presented
mild dementia with progression and fluctuations for the last 5 years, scanning
speech and wide-base gait. Due to a significantly elevated level of anti-thyroid
peroxidase antibodies, steroid responsive encephalopathy in autoimmune
thyroiditis (STREAT) was suspected and steroids were administered. This was a
trigger factor for the patient developing coma with severe hyperammonemia.
Consequent genetic testing identified a pathogenic variant of the OTC (ornithine
transcarbamylase) gene.
COMMENT: Late-onset ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency can be a rare cause of
cognitive impairment. It is reasonable to determine the level of ammonia in
patients with non-specific symptoms, as hyperammonemia can cause permanent brain
damage.

PURPOSE: The aim of the case is to present the significance of a thorough
analysis of the cases of patients with newly developed memory disorders
accompanied by epileptic seizures.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a 61-year-old male patient who was
admitted to the hospital due to unexplained memory disorders and seizures.
Further examination showed the presence of anti-LGI1 (leucine-rich
glioma-inactivated 1) antibodies. Computed tomography of the abdominal cavity
revealed a mass located between the stomach and the spleen. Histopathological
examination identified the mass as a gastrointestinal tumour (GIST). After the
surgical removal of the tumour the symptoms were significantly reduced. The
early diagnosis and treatment of the tumour contributed to favourable
neurological and oncological outcomes for the patient.
COMMENT: Paraneoplastic neurological syndrome is a clinical condition in which
the functioning of the nervous system is impaired, not resulting from local
tumour growth or metastases. The currently recognized underlaying mechanism of
this condition is an autoimmune reaction occurring in the patient's body. In
response to the presence of tumour, the antibodies called onconeural antibodies
are produced, which are then directed against antigens present on the nervous
system cells. To the best of our knowledge this is the first and so far only
anti-LGI1-antibody autoimmune encephalitis as a neurological paraneoplastic
syndrome associated with GIST.

INTRODUCTION: Aim of this analysis in to assess the prevalence and
post-procedural outcomes of surgical bailout during transcatheter aortic valve
implantation (TAVI).
METHODS: Patients undergoing TAVI from September 2017 to March 2023 were
enrolled from two high volume centers. All the procedures were performed with
on-site cardiac surgery, but especially the scrubbed cardiac surgeon. The
primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality of TAVI patients after emergent
cardiac surgery (ECS). Secondary endpoints were intra-operative and 1-year
mortality, and post-procedural complications such as acute kidney injury (AKI),
stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), conduction abnormalities, need for inotropic
support and intensive care unit (ICU) and in- hospital length of stay.
RESULTS: A total of 1347 consecutive patients underwent transfemoral TAVI. Ten
patients (0.74 %), representing the study population, reported intra-procedural
complications requiring ECS: seven patients received a self-expandable
prosthesis; three patients received a balloon expandable prosthesis. Indications
for ECS included: type A dissection (n = 2), aortic annulus rupture (n = 1),
left(n = 1) and right (n = 2) ventricle perforation, mitral valve apparatus
damage (n = 2), prosthesis embolization (n = 2). Four patients required
post-operative inotropic support. One case of minor stroke and one case of AKI
(grade III) were reported. Three patients developed a post procedural left
bundle branch block (LBBB). Median ICU and hospital length-of-stay were 4.5
(2-7.75) days and 14 (8-22) days, respectively. One case of in-hospital
mortality was reported.
CONCLUSIONS: The on-site cardiac surgery, with the scrubbed heart surgeon,
represents a life-saving resource for TAVI centers in case of ECS, and it is
essential to achieve low-rate in-hospital mortality.

Introduction Clear escalation plans are critical to patient safety, particularly
during periods of out-of-hours work. This is supported by guidance developed by
the Royal College of Physicians, which states that all patients should have an
escalation plan documented. Despite this, documentation is often inconsistent
due to the complexity and time-consuming nature of these decisions.
Nevertheless, accessibility to this information is imperative for effective
handover between clinical teams and contributes towards delivering safe patient
care. Methods The Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle methodology was used. Thirty
patient notes were reviewed to assess the clarity of documentation regarding do
not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DNAR) decisions, escalation planning,
and weekend handover. Based on these findings, a standardised proforma was
developed to evaluate the impact of the intervention on clinical practice.
Subsequent PDSA cycles were implemented across the Gastroenterology ward.
Results Following the introduction of the proforma, there were significant
improvements in the quality of documentation. DNAR documentation increased from
47% to 90%, escalation planning improved from 23% to 81%, and weekend handover
documentation rose from 47% to 100%. Conclusion The use of a standardised
proforma improved the documentation and handover of patients in the
Gastroenterology ward. This project demonstrated the positive impact of using a
structured format to record key clinical information, thereby contributing to
safer patient care. As a result, the proforma has been adopted by other wards
within the hospital.

We hereby present a case of thrombus or possible vertebral artery dissection
(VAD), but no confirmatory evidence in a young adult male, diagnosed using an
unusual but pivotal imaging clue, the "dense vertebral artery sign" observed on
non-contrast computed tomography (CT). This finding led to the initial suspicion
and subsequent confirmation of VAD. This report underscores the diagnostic value
of subtle vascular signs on plain CT imaging that are frequently overlooked but
can result in prompt and life-saving intervention. This report is of particular
significance in emergency settings, where advanced imaging modalities such as
MRI and CT angiography may not be readily available.

INTRODUCTION: In clinical practice, it is common to see stroke and trauma
simultaneously in the same patient. When such a patient presents to the
emergency department (ED), rapid assessment must be done to adequately manage
both conditions. As the assessment will cover a significant number of steps and
tasks to be accomplished, it may prove challenging, especially for a novice
practitioner. As a result, key diagnostic signs may be missed or overlooked.
This may cause nondiagnosis, misdiagnosis, or delay in the handling of
time-dependent diagnoses (e.g. thrombolytic therapy decision for stroke and
recognition of early shock in trauma). Therefore, the need for a comprehensive
approach to the management of the patient who has simultaneous acute stroke and
trauma is needed.
METHODS: We propose the Stroke-Trauma (STRAUMA) Code framework for use in the ED
and by first-line healthcare staff. We used a trans-continental approach by
testing our proposed STRAUMA framework at two centers: in the Department of
Emergency Medicine at Singapore General Hospital in Singapore and in the
Emergency Care Center at Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Sarasota, Florida, USA.
RESULTS: Both teams agreed that the new proposed STRAUMA Code framework is
systematic, structured, and organized thus making it easier to apply in the
clinical setting.
CONCLUSION: A structured approach to manage the more complex cases presenting to
the ED is useful so as not to miss important and often critical information and
steps which will affect patient management as well as outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Perinatal cerebral infarction (PCI) is a common cause of
neurological complications in neonates. This study aimed to compare the clinical
characteristics and risk factors of perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (PAIS)
and perinatal hemorrhagic stroke (PHS) to inform early recognition and
intervention strategies.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 124 neonates diagnosed with
PCI, admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) between June 2015 and
December 2023. The neonates were divided into two groups-PAIS and PHS-based on
clinical symptoms and cranial imaging findings.
RESULTS: Of the 124 patients, 87 (70.2%) were diagnosed with PAIS, while 37
(29.8%) had PHS. Clonic seizures were observed in 78 cases (62.9%), with apnoea
noted in 11 cases (12.6%) within the PAIS group and jaundice in 8 cases (21.6%)
within the PHS group. Lesions were primarily located in the left cerebral
hemisphere in 53 cases (41.4%), whereas PHS lesions frequently involved the
thalamus and basal ganglia (12 cases, 32.4%). Statistical analysis revealed
significant differences in risk factors between the PAIS and PHS groups. The
PAIS group had a higher rate of conversion from failed trial of labor to
cesarean section compared to the PHS group (P = 0.012). Additionally, postnatal
thrombocytopenia was more commonly associated with the PHS group than the PAIS
group (P = 0.034).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that PAIS is more prevalent within the
studied population, with a notable correlation between failed labor trials
resulting in cesarean sections and the incidence of PAIS. This suggests a
potential link between complications during labor and the occurrence of ischemic
strokes. In contrast, postnatal thrombocytopenia was found to be significantly
more common in the PHS group, indicating a possible association between low
platelet counts and hemorrhagic strokes.

INTRODUCTION: Although rare, common carotid artery occlusion (CCAO) causes
ischemic neurological dysfunction, which can be treated by revascularization.
Although several bypass approaches for CCAO have been suggested, no consensus on
the surgical revascularization approach and its functional outcome have been
reached. Herein, we present a case of Rile's type 1A CCAO in which a subclavian
artery (SclA)-internal carotid artery (ICA) bypass using a radial artery graft
(RAG) resulted in immediate recovery of cognitive function and successfully
prevented ischemic stroke.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 58-year-old man presented with recurrent episodes of
right-sided weakness. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple
cerebral infarcts. Digital subtraction angiography confirmed left CCAO and no
anterograde blood flow in the left ICA and ipsilateral external carotid artery.
A bypass was performed from the left SclA to the left cervical ICA using a left
RAG, and supraclavicular anastomosis between the SclA and ICA was performed
without graft-vessel kinking. Postoperatively, no neurological deficits were
observed, and his cognitive function was successfully improved.
CONCLUSION: SclA-ICA bypass using an RAG can be a reasonable treatment option
for CCAO. CCAO revascularization can prevent ischemic stroke and improve
cognitive function.

Gaps in Artificial Intelligence Research for Rural Health in the United States:
A Scoping Review.
Brown KE, Davis SE.
BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has impacted healthcare at urban and
academic medical centers globally. The current focus on AI deployments in urban
areas and the history of US urban-rural digital divides raises concerns that the
promise of AI may not be realized in rural communities. This may exacerbate
well-documented health disparities. Without the benefits of AI-driven
improvements in patient outcomes and increased efficiency, rural healthcare
facilities may fall farther behind their urban counterparts and rural hospital
closure rates may continue to rise.
METHODS: We conducted a scoping review following the PRISMA guidelines. We
included peer-reviewed, original research studies indexed in PubMed, Embase, and
WebOfScience after January 1, 2010 and through April 29, 2025. Studies were
required to discuss the development, implementation, or evaluation of AI tools
in rural US healthcare, including frameworks that help facilitate AI development
(e.g., data warehouses).
FINDINGS: Our search strategy found 26 studies meeting inclusion criteria after
full text screening with 14 papers discussing predictive AI models and 12 papers
discussing data or research infrastructure. AI models most commonly targeted
resource allocation and distribution. Few studies explored model deployment and
impact. Half noted the lack of data and analytic resources as a limitation to
both development and validation. None of the studies discussed examples of
generative AI being trained, evaluated, or deployed in a rural setting.
INTERPRETATION: Practical limitations may be influencing and limiting the types
of AI models evaluated in the rural US. We noted validation of tools in the
rural US was underwhelming, and ultimately, neglected. With few studies moving
beyond AI model design and development stages, there is a clear gap in our
understanding of how to reliably validate, deploy, and sustain AI models in
rural settings to advance health in all communities.
FUNDING: National Library of Medicine.
RESEARCH IN CONTEXT: Evidence before this study: Clinical artificial
intelligence (AI)-both for prediction modeling and generative tools- tools
promise to reduce care delays, improve diagnosis and treatment decision-making,
reduce care costs, and improve efficiency to reduce provider workload and
enhance practice management. Unfortunately, efforts to deploy artificial
intelligence (AI)-both for prediction modeling and generative tools-in
healthcare are advancing, primarily at large academic medical centers and in
urban areas. An emerging new digital divide in the use of clinical AI could
exacerbate the well-documented health disparities between urban and rural
communities in the United States. A better understanding of if and how AI is
being developed, deployed, and evaluated across rural US communities is
necessary to identify resources gaps and challenges to broad AI use in all
communities.Added value of this study: This study analyzes the current state of
artificial intelligence research in the rural United States. For predictive AI
models, applications most commonly targeted resource allocation and
distribution. We noted several attempts to predict resource utilization of
patients who were either tested or tested positive to COVID-19. However, we
noted few AI solutions for acute medical events faced by rural patients, such as
trauma and stroke, despite worse outcomes for rural patients suffering from
these acute events. The limited availability of time-critical specialties such
as trauma/emergency medicine, neurology, and cardiology in rural areas often
necessitates patients with such conditions be transferred to larger, more
resourced hospitals. Practical limitations may be influencing and limiting the
types of AI models evaluated in rural US medical facilities. The most frequent
model employed were tree-based ensembles, such as random forests and
gradient-boosting trees. Our review also highlighted few studies of AI models
moving beyond the design and develop stages, leaving a clear gap in our
understanding of how to deploy and sustain predictive AI models in rural
settings. Several challenges noted in the reviewed studies may provide insight
into this lack of translation from research to implementation. We note that
validation of A tools in the rural US was underwhelming, and ultimately,
neglected. The most common form of model validation employed was a single random
holdout test set. Half of the included papers mentioned a lack of reliable data
sources or limited data volume as a potential challenge in developing and
adopting AI/ML tools. The use of patient-level EHR data was often limited to
what was available to the authors or at a specific medical center.Implications
of all the available evidence: Our review indicates a gap and highlights
opportunity for innovation in leveraging AI tools to predict and support
patients in rural communities. Further research is needed to enhance the
translation of state-of-the-art modeling techniques into effective AI tools for
use in the rural US, including exploring partnerships between academic medical
centers and rural communities and solutions to logistic challenges of such
partnerships, including data and resource sharing.

BACKGROUND: Abnormal muscle co-activation contributes to arm impairment after
stroke. This single-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial evaluated the
feasibility and efficacy of home-based, personalized myoelectric interface for
neurorehabilitation (MINT) conditioning to reduce abnormal co-activation and
enhance arm function and determine the optimal number of abnormally
co-activating muscles to target during training.
METHODS: Moderately to severely impaired chronic stroke survivors were
randomized to one of three MINT groups (who played customized games requiring
independent activation of 2 or 3 abnormally co-activating muscles) or a sham
control group (played using one muscle). All groups trained 90 minutes/day, 5
days/week at home and 1 day/week in lab, for 6 weeks, and changed trained muscle
sets every 2-3 weeks. The primary outcome was the Wolf Motor Function Test
(WMFT) at 6 weeks.
RESULTS: Fifty-nine participants completed the training. Participants performed
315 ± 85 (mean ± SD) repetitions daily. At week 6, participants in all MINT
groups combined improved by 4 s on WMFT (p=0.0008), exceeding the minimal
clinically important difference (1.5 s). Participants who trained 3 muscles
simultaneously improved by 6.8 s (p=0.001), while the 2-muscle and sham groups
did not change significantly. In per-protocol analysis, the 3-muscle group, but
not 2-muscle groups, improved significantly more than sham (p=0.046), though not
in intention-to-treat analysis. All MINT groups continued improving at 4 weeks
post-training. Importantly, severely impaired participants in combined MINT
groups improved more than those in sham (p=0.02). Importantly, combined MINT
groups also improved their reaching range of motion significantly more than
sham. Co-activation decreased by 76% in MINT groups during training. Notably,
reduction in co-activation during reaching correlated significantly with
improved arm function and range of motion. Other secondary outcomes did not show
clinically important improvement. Stroke involving the posterior limb of the
internal capsule negatively predicted response to MINT.
CONCLUSIONS: Home-based MINT conditioning, especially the 3-muscle variant, is
feasible, reduces co-activation, and improves arm movement and function.

Predicting Post-Stroke Gait and Balance Function with Simple Neuromotor
Measures.
Lasonde M, Augenstein TE, Shin D, Startup JJ, Claflin ES, Richardson JK,
Krishnan C.
BACKGROUND: Stroke commonly results in permanent damage to central neural
circuits. At a physiological level, this damage manifests as neuromotor
impairments like reduced muscle strength, altered coordination, and delayed
reaction time. At a functional level, this damage results in reduced gait speed,
endurance, and balance ability, which leads to long-term disability and loss of
independence. However, the interplay between these neuromotor impairments and
functional disability is not well understood. An understanding of these
relationships is critical to tailoring rehabilitation approaches for post-stroke
recovery.
METHODS: We measured upper extremity neuromotor capacities as well as mobility
and balance measures in 20 chronic stroke survivors and 20 age- and sex-matched
controls for this cross-sectional, case-control study. The upper extremity
neuromotor capacities included grip strength and various reaction time measures
(simple reaction time [SRT], reaction accuracy [All Accuracy], and All
Accuracy/SRT) derived using the ReacStick-a novel instrumented ruler-drop test
that provides greater ecological validity than computer-based measures. The
mobility and balance measures included preferred gait speed, 6-minute walking
distance, timed up-and-go test, and single leg balance ability. ANOVAs were used
to make between-limb and between-group comparisons, and linear and logistic
regression analyses were used to evaluate the neuromotor capacities as
predictors of mobility and balance.
RESULTS: All neuromotor capacities except All Accuracy and all mobility and
balance measures were negatively affected by stroke (all p <0.02). We observed
that grip strength symmetry (the ratio of grip strength in the paretic limb to
the nonparetic limb) was the primary predictor of all mobility measures (all p
≤0.014), and SRT symmetry and paretic All Accuracy/SRT were the primary
predictors of balance (all p ≤0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: These results serve as foundational evidence for the relationship
between neuromotor performance and functional ability following a stroke and may
present an accessible clinical tool for safe measurement of post-stroke mobility
and balance.

INTRODUCTION: This study aims to compare different playing styles on external
training load and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) in elite Hungarian junior
tennis players during the off-season in winning vs. losing matches.
METHODS: Sixteen elite male junior tennis players from the same club
participated in this study (aggressive baseliner: n = 9; counterpuncher: n = 7),
and each player was required to play three simulated matches. We measured eleven
activity profiles, fourteen external training load variables, and the subjective
RPE parameter for all matches. For the activity profile measure, we used video
cameras, and for the external training load, we used a 10 Hz global navigation
satellite system (GNSS) with integrated 100 Hz inertial measurement units (IMU).
RESULTS: For the different playing styles, we found that aggressive baseliner
players produce more high-intensity (≤-2 m/s2) decelerations (p = 0.015;
r = 0.35), and higher other stroke load values (p = 0.009; r = 0.38), than
counterpuncher players. However, in the other external training load and RPE
variables we did not find any significance differences (p > 0.05). For the match
outcomes, we found that the running load (p = 0.013; r = 0.50) values were
higher in winning situations, while the RPE (p = 0.000; r = 0.79) values were
greater in losing matches. However, apart from this, we did not find any
significant differences in the other parameters (p > 0.05).
DISCUSSION: In conclusion, aggressive baseliner players must develop more
movements toward the net and the necessary adjustment steps for volleys.
Furthermore, running activities do not necessarily influence match outcomes,
therefore, it is important to place more emphasis on the development and
monitoring of technical and tactical situations. Based on these points, we
recommend that coaches integrate the development of specific footwork and
dominant technical-tactical actions simultaneously on the court, so that players
can better incorporate these elements into their game.

INTRODUCTION: Growing evidence suggests that corticospinal tract (CST) damage
and microstructural integrity are key predictors of post-stroke motor
impairment. However, their combined clinical utility-particularly in CST
sub-pathways originating from non-primary motor cortical areas-remains
underexplored. This study aimed to determine whether microstructural integrity
and lesion load (LL) of each CST sub-pathway at 2 weeks predict motor outcomes
at 2, 6, and 12 weeks post-stroke.
METHODS: Fifty seven participants completed motor and neuroimaging evaluations
at 2 weeks post-stroke and underwent follow-up motor assessments at 6 (n = 37)
and 12 weeks (n = 34). The integrity of the CSTs was quantified using diffusion
spectrum imaging (DSI), while CST-LL was measured using structural magnetic
resonance imaging, both based on the sensorimotor area tract template atlas.
Stepwise multiple linear regression models were used to assess the predictive
value of CST microstructural integrity and CST-LL in each sub-pathway at 2 weeks
for motor function at 2, 6, and 12 weeks post-stroke.
RESULTS: The results indicated CST integrity and CST-LL were both the main
determinants of motor deficit at 2 weeks post-stroke. Specifically, the
integrity of CSTs from the primary motor cortex (M1), reflected by fractional
anisotropy, emerged as a significant predictor of post-stroke motor deficit at 2
weeks, whereas CST integrity from the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), reflected by
generalized fractional anisotropy, quantitative anisotropy, and radial
diffusivity. CST-LL originating from non-M1 motor areas, such as primary sensory
cortex (S1), were also the main determinants for motor impairment at 2 weeks
post-stroke. However, compared to CST integrity, CST-LL from non-M1 motor areas,
including both the PMd and S1, were more dominant predictors, explaining 68.3%
(R 2 adjusted = 0.683, p < 0.001) and 79.5% (R 2 adjusted = 0.795, p < 0.001) of
the variance in motor outcomes at 6 and 12 weeks.
CONCLUSION: The microstructural integrity of the PMd tracts and CST-LL from the
non-M1 motor areas may be promising biomarker for post-stroke motor impairment.
These findings highlight the pivotal role of non-M1 tracts in post-stroke motor
function, particularly the PMd tracts, as a potential intervention target to
enhance motor recovery.

A Case of Stanford Type A Aortic Dissection Presenting as Syncope and Neurologic
Deficits Without Pain: Diagnostic Pitfalls and a Therapeutic Dilemma.
Ismail U(1).
(1)Medicine, NHS Wales, Wales, GBR.
Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a true medical emergency that classically
presents with sudden severe tearing chest pain that may radiate to the back or
with tearing abdominal pain. When it presents atypically without pain,
diagnostic delays or misdiagnosis are common, often with devastating
consequences. We report the case of a 59-year-old male with uncontrolled
hypertension who first presented to an outside emergency department (ED) with
multiple collapses and was discharged after assessment. He presented 48 hours
later to our ED following collapse and loss of consciousness. The patient was in
shock upon arrival. Transient right upper limb weakness and slurring of speech
were noted on initial assessment. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with cardiogenic
shock was suspected on the basis of electrocardiographic (ECG) changes and
raised troponin, and ACS treatment was administered. However, bedside
echocardiogram performed to assess left ventricular function as part of the ACS
work-up suggested Stanford type A AAD, which was confirmed by computed tomogram
(CT) of the aorta. Emergency surgical repair of the aorta was performed after
transfer to a tertiary hospital, with good postoperative recovery. This case
highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for aortic
dissection in patients presenting with syncope and neurological deficits even in
the absence of classical symptoms. Simulation training specifically tailored to
scenarios of atypical presentations of AAD may be of benefit to emergency
clinicians and help reduce the unacceptably high rate of misdiagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Heatwaves and hurricanes pose risks to public health, especially for
vulnerable populations.
METHODS: We assessed the impact of extreme weather events on health outcomes in
socially vulnerable groups. We analyzed hospital mortality, acute stroke,
myocardial infarction, and nonelective intensive care unit (ICU) admissions for
24,814 patients admitted to two hospitals in Jacksonville (2015-2017). We fitted
modified Poisson regression models to assess differences relative to the
heatwave and Hurricane Irma, presenting impacts with relative risks (RR) and 95%
confidence intervals (CI).
RESULTS: There was no significant change in the rate of acute stroke or
myocardial infarction during both the heatwave and Hurricane Irma. The rate of
nonelective ICU admission showed no significant change during the heatwave and
immediate posthurricane period (0-14 days after the hurricane) but increased
during the extended posthurricane period (15-74 days after the hurricane) with
an RR of 6.19 (95% CI = 1.25, 30.54) compared with the control period. Extreme
climate events amplified disparities among vulnerable patient populations.
During heatwave and extended posthurricane periods, the rate of acute stroke or
myocardial infarction increased for elderly patients relative to younger
patients with RRs of 1.43 (95% CI = 1.05, 1.94) and 1.53 (95% CI = 1.14, 2.07),
and uninsured or Medicaid-insured patients relative to those with Medicare or
private insurance with RRs of 1.71 (95% CI = 1.26, 2.33) and 1.88 (95% CI =
1.38, 2.59). Social vulnerability and air quality further impacted health
outcomes during the extended posthurricane period, with a 0.1-unit increase in
the Social Vulnerability Index score associated with a 65% decrease in risk of
acute stroke or myocardial infarction with RR of 0.35 (95% CI = 0.16, 0.75) and
a 69% decrease in risk of nonelective ICU admissions with RR of 0.31 (95% CI =
0.15-0.65), and a 1-unit increase in Air Quality Index value indicated a 2%
increase in risk of acute stroke or myocardial infarction with RR of 1.02 (95%
CI = 1.01, 1.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest extreme climate events exacerbate negative
health outcomes in socioeconomically vulnerable populations, underscoring the
need for targeted public health interventions, improved healthcare access, and
greater climate resilience in vulnerable communities.

BACKGROUND: In the aftermath of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the clearance of
harmful substances from the hematoma helps to mitigate brain edema and reduce
the risk of subsequent neurological damage. This study aimed to investigate the
mechanism underlying early hematoma processing following ICH and to explore the
potential of modulating this process via astrocyte regulation.
METHODS: ICH was induced by intrastriatal injection of bacterial collagenase. A
calcium channel blocker, pyr3, was used to suppress astrocyte activity, or
combined with PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) agonists
(rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) as the intervention approach. The rats were
randomly assigned to the following groups: ICH with vehicle treatment, ICH with
pyr3 treatment, ICH with rosiglitazone treatment, ICH with pioglitazone
treatment, ICH with pyr3 and rosiglitazone treatment, and ICH with pyr3 and
pioglitazone treatment. Drugs were administered via the intraventricular route
into the contralateral ventricle 10 minutes after ICH induction. The evolution
of hematoma within the first 21 hours was meticulously examined using
T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Motor behavioral testing and
diffusion-weighted imaging were used to assess longer-lasting functional
outcomes and edema. To assess astrocyte-specific responses, an astrocyte cell
line was incubated with hemin followed by different drug treatments. An
intracellular hemin assay was used to quantify the hemin uptake capacity of
astrocytes.
RESULTS: Delayed signaling transitions of the hematoma were observed in the ICH
with pyr3 treatment group in T2-weighted images, manifesting in different ICH
models (ANOVA; P<0.001). The additional treatment of rosiglitazone rescued the
delayed signaling transition (ANOVA; P<0.01) with a slight reduction in hematoma
volume (ANOVA; P<0.001). ICH with pyr3 and pioglitazone treatment group
exhibited improved motor behavior (ANOVA; P<0.001), gait (ANOVA; P<0.001), and
reduced brain water content (ANOVA; P<0.01) than ICH with the vehicle treatment
group. In cultured astrocytes, the combined treatment group showed increased
HCP-1 (heme carrier protein-1) expression and hemin uptake within a few hours
(P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Combined treatment with the calcium channel blocker, pyr3, and the
PPARγ agonist accelerated the early absorption of heme iron by resting-state
astrocytes, leading to improved functional performance and reduced edema in
later stages.

BACKGROUND: Long-term follow-up studies in severe mitral stenosis (MS) with low
transmitral mean diastolic pressure gradient (MDPG) are not available. We
evaluated the prognostic implications of severe MS with low MDPG in our MASTER
(Multicenter Mitral Stenosis with Rheumatic Etiology) registry.
METHODS: We included patients with severe rheumatic MS (mitral valve area ≤1.5
cm2) from the long-term MASTER registry. Patients were categorized into high (≥5
mm Hg) or low (<5 mm Hg) MDPG groups. The primary outcome was a composite of
all-cause mortality and stroke.
RESULTS: Among 1248 patients with severe MS, 322 (25.8%) had low MDPG and 926
(74.2%) had high MDPG. Their mean age was 59±13 years, 25% were men, and 74% had
atrial fibrillation. Patients with low MDPG were older and had a higher
prevalence of atrial fibrillation. During a mean follow-up of 6.8±5.9 years, 194
(15.5%) patients experienced major adverse events. Patients who had low MDPG
sustained more events than those with high MDPG (hazard ratio, 1.56 [95% CI,
1.15-2.12]; P=0.004), and low MDPG was independently associated with poor
outcome (hazard ratio, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.02-1.97]; P=0.038) in the multivariable
model. In the subgroup analysis of patients with low MDPG, decreased LA
reservoir strain was independently associated with poor outcome (hazard ratio,
3.22 [95% CI, 1.25-8.31]; P=0.016).
CONCLUSIONS: Severe patients with MS and low MDPG carried a greater risk of
adverse events than those with high MDPG and had less frequent and delayed
mitral valve intervention. Also, it is not necessarily indicative of milder
hemodynamic encumbrance. LA reservoir strain could help identify a subgroup
associated with poor prognosis in patients with low MDPG.

BACKGROUND: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is an essential tool for
heart failure (HF) assessment but is limited by load dependence. Additional
tools are needed to risk-stratify normal LVEF populations. We aimed to assess
the prognostic value of systolic blood pressure-indexed left ventricular
end-systolic volume ratio, or cardiac contractility index (CCI).
METHODS: In a prospective observational cohort study of people newly diagnosed
with HF, we defined characteristics and outcomes associated with LVEF and CCI,
including after stratification into HF with reduced ejection fraction or HF with
preserved ejection fraction. We used UK Biobank to assess whether CCI is
associated with subclinical myocardial dysfunction and incident HF.
RESULTS: In people with HF, mortality increased over tertiles of declining CCI
(P<0.001). Within the HF preserved ejection fraction group, below-median CCI was
associated with distinct clinical characteristics and an all-cause mortality
risk approximately twice that of those with above median CCI (observed event
rate 17.3/100 patient-years versus 8.8/100 patient-years; P<0.001), similar to
those with HF with reduced ejection fraction. Modeled as continuous variables,
there was a curvilinear relationship between mortality across the detected range
of CCI, while there was no clear association with mortality risk across a wide
range of LVEF (20%-55%). In UK Biobank for participants without HF and normal
LVEF, below-median CCI was associated with ≈33% increased risk of incident heart
failure (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.33 [1.01-1.75]; P=0.043). Decreasing CCI was
also associated with lower myocardial contractility defined using global radial
and circumferential strain.
CONCLUSIONS: CCI is a simple, noninvasive, relatively afterload-independent
method to stratify HF risk in populations with normal LVEF. Its simplicity means
CCI could be applied to existing clinical trial data sets or used be as an
inclusion criterion in future randomized controlled trials.

BACKGROUND: International guidelines recommend standardized dysphagia screening
in acute stroke, as up to 75% of patients develop poststroke dysphagia. While
medication swallowing is also advised for assessment, no validated screening
tools or instrumental evidence exist on solid dosage form (SDF) management.
Whole tablets are often crushed to reduce aspiration risk, yet the actual risk
of aspiration for both forms remains unknown. Despite its widespread clinical
use, crushed medication swallowing has never been evaluated using fiberoptic
endoscopic evaluation of swallowing. Closing this evidence gap is essential for
guiding safe medication administration in patients with dysphagic stroke.
METHODS: A prospective, single-center, cross-sectional study with an
experimental design was conducted on 60 patients with acute stroke (<7 days).
The swallowing safety and efficiency of 1 crushed placebo tablet and 3 different
types of whole placebo tablets, each administered with an accompanying
applesauce bolus, were compared using fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of
swallowing. The primary outcome was the incidence of unsafe swallowing, as
determined by the Penetration-Aspiration Scale. Secondary outcomes included the
presence and location of pharyngeal residue associated with each SDF condition.
RESULTS: Of 60 patients with stroke (mean age, 73.4±10.7 years; 55% male) with a
median Gugging Swallowing Screen score of 14 indicating moderate dysphagia, 58
patients completed the crushed SDFs trial. Whole SDFs were not swallowed
(chewed, spit out, and stopped) in 20 of the 174 trials. All fully swallowed
tablets (n=154) were safe, with no penetration or aspiration observed. In
contrast, 22 of 154 accompanying boli (14.3%) and 7 of 58 crushed SDFs (12.1%)
were rated unsafe, without a significant difference. Crushed SDFs caused
significantly more vallecular residues (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the need to reconsider the routine
practice of crushing SDFs for patients with dysphagic stroke. A paradigm shift
towards using whole SDFs, guided by fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of
swallowing, could enable more frequent administration, reduce errors, and
enhance medication efficacy.

BACKGROUND: Epigenetic modifications 5-methylcytosine and
5-hydroxymethylcytosine in DNA regulate neuronal survival under ischemic stress.
We previously showed that TET3 (ten-eleven translocation 3)-mediated
5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine conversion induces neuroprotective
gene transcription after stroke. As TET3 neuronal isoform lacks the DNA-binding
domain, how TET3 drives 5-hydroxymethylcytosine-mediated transcriptional
induction in the ischemic brain remains unclear. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)
act as structural scaffolds to recruit chromatin-modifying proteins and other
RNAs to specific genomic loci. However, whether TET3 requires an lncRNA to drive
DNA hydroxymethylation in the ischemic brain is unknown.
METHODS: Adult male and female mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion. TET3-bound lncRNAs were immunoprecipitated from peri-infarct
cortex, and TILR (TET3-interacting lncRNA; AK020504) identified was inhibited
with small interfering RNA injected at 5 minutes of reperfusion. Ascorbate was
administered at 30 minutes of reperfusion to induce TET3 activity. Poststroke
DNA hydroxymethylation was assessed with hydroxymethylation DNA
immunoprecipitation sequencing, and sensorimotor deficits, and infarct volume
were evaluated between days 1 and 7 of reperfusion.
RESULTS: TILR binds to TET3 with high affinity and was significantly upregulated
in the peri-infarct cortex at 12 hours of reperfusion. Knockdown of TILR
increased the infarct volume and reduced the motor function recovery after
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, in a TET3-dependent manner. On
contrary, TET3 activation by ascorbate decreased brain damage and improved motor
function recovery after ischemia. However, ascorbate-induced postischemic
protection was abrogated by TILR knockdown. Genome-wide profiling showed that
ascorbate increases the number of differentially hydroxymethylated regions in
the poststroke genome, a neuroprotective effect that is reversed by TILR
knockdown. Moreover, TILR inhibition significantly reduced the DNA
hydroxymethylation in the intergenic regions associated with enhancers, super
enhancers, and the promoters of other lncRNAs, microRNAs, and PIWI-interacting
RNAs.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the essential role of TILR in
TET3-mediated 5-hydroxymethylcytosine-dependent epigenetic reprogramming in the
ischemic brain.

BACKGROUND: The Harmony transcatheter pulmonary valve (TPV) is designed to treat
severe pulmonary regurgitation in the native or surgically repaired right
ventricular (RV) outflow tract. Early outcomes after TPV replacement with the
Harmony valve have been positive, but longer-term data are limited.
METHODS: The study included patients who received a commercially available TPV22
or TPV25 device as part of the nonrandomized, prospective Native Outflow Tract
Early Feasibility Study, Harmony Pivotal Trial, and Continued Access Study.
Patients completed at least 3 years of follow-up, and outcomes to 5 years were
reported when available.
RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients were catheterized, and 86 were successfully
implanted with a Harmony TPV. Median duration of follow-up was 5 (range 0-6)
years in the TPV22 group and 3 (1-4) years in the TPV25 group. At 3 years, all
patients with a TPV22 and 96% of those with a TPV25 had ≤mild pulmonary
regurgitation. By magnetic resonance imaging, significant improvements from
preimplant to 2 years were observed in RV end-diastolic volume index, RV to left
ventricular end-diastolic volume ratio, and effective RV stroke volume (all
P<0.001). SF-36 quality-of-life scores improved after Harmony implantation and
were sustained over 3 years. Early cases of ventricular tachycardia resolved,
and there were no new arrhythmias. Adverse events up to 5 years included 3
deaths unrelated to the device or procedure, 2 cases of endocarditis that were
treated (1 medically, 1 transcatheter debulking of a vegetation) and resolved, 6
patients with RV outflow tract obstruction and thrombosis resulting in valve-in
valve procedures, and 1 major stent fracture resulting in surgical explant.
CONCLUSIONS: At 3 to 5 years, Harmony TPV replacement resulted in sustained
valve competence, beneficial cardiac remodeling, and improved quality of life.
Continued monitoring is needed to assess long-term outcomes and valve
performance.

BACKGROUND: Intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen
activator, such as alteplase, is the standard treatment for acute ischemic
stroke (AIS). However, concerns about cost and safety have led to an interest in
alternative thrombolytics like prourokinase (rhPro-UK). This meta-analysis
evaluated the efficacy and safety of prourokinase compared to alteplase for AIS
treatment within 4.5 hours of symptom onset.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted across PubMed, Web of Science, and
Scopus up to January 2025. The outcome measures included functional outcomes
(modified Rankin Scale [mRS]), early neurological improvement (NIHSS reduction),
and safety outcomes, involving symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH).
PROSPERO registration is CRD42025632210.
RESULTS: Three RCTs with a total of 2,289 patients were included. The proportion
of patients achieving excellent functional outcomes (mRS 0-1 at 90 days) did not
differ significantly between groups (risk ratio (RR): 1.04, 95% confidence
interval (CI): 0.98-1.10, p = 0.17). Similarly, good functional outcomes (mRS
0-2) were comparable (p = 0.86). Early neurological improvement at 24 hours was
also similar (p = 0.32). However, prourokinase showed a slight but statistically
significant advantage in NIHSS score reduction at 24 hours (mean difference
(MD): -0.43, 95% CI: -0.85 to -0.02, p = 0.04). The risk of sICH, defined by
ECASS III (p = 0.16) and SITS-MOST (p = 0.07), showed insignificant difference.
CONCLUSION: Prourokinase is a safe and effective thrombolytic agent for AIS
within 4.5 hours, demonstrating non-inferiority to alteplase in both efficacy
and safety. Its advantages, including lower cost and ease of administration,
make it a viable alternative. Future large-scale trials are recommended.

ObjectiveMechanical thrombectomy (MT) is well-established for the treatment of
acute ischemic stroke (AIS) from large vessel occlusion (LVO), with growing data
supporting the expansion to distal and medium vessel occlusions (DMVO). Despite
successful recanalization in DMVO, certain patients still experience poor
long-term clinical outcomes, prompting our study to comprehensively explore
pre-MT factors influencing outcome despite excellent recanalization (final
modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction [mTICI] score ≥2c).MethodsWe
retrospectively examined data from patients who consecutively underwent MT for a
primary middle cerebral artery (MCA) DMVO across 37 centers in North America,
Asia, and Europe. We identified baseline clinical and imaging factors associated
with poor clinical outcome (defined as a modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score of
3-6) at 3 months, despite excellent recanalization using a multivariable
model.ResultsBetween September 2017 and July 2021, 623 patients achieved
mTICI > 2b and they were included in our study. Among them, 198 (32%)
experienced a poor clinical outcome (mRS 3-6). Predictors of poor clinical
outcome included higher age (OR 1.05 [1.03-1.07], p < 0.001), higher NIHSS at
admission (OR 1.12 [1.08-1.15], p < 0.001), higher baseline mRS (OR 1.77
[0.96-3.26], p = 0.067), and diabetes (OR 1.59 [1.01-2.48], p = 0.044). Higher
ASPECTS was associated with a decreased risk of poor clinical outcome (OR 0.82
[0.71-0.94], p = 0.006).ConclusionOlder age, diabetes, higher baseline mRS, and
NIHSS were associated with poor clinical outcome in MCA DMVO despite excellent
recanalization. Conversely, a higher ASPECTS decreased the probability of such
an outcome.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid
artery stenting (CAS) is recommended for symptomatic extracranial carotid
stenosis of 50-99%, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted resources. CAS
therefore offered potential advantages as access to the angiosuite was seemingly
easier than access to operating rooms. The primary objective was to determine
the frequency of serious and non-serious complications following CAS before and
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients who
received CAS at the Ottawa Hospital, Canada, from June 2019 to May 2021. We
reviewed baseline demographics, imaging, as well as intraprocedural and
postprocedural complications based on chart review. We performed multivariable
logistic regression to determine associations between clinical and safety
outcomes.
RESULTS: We included 47 patients in the pre-pandemic period and 93 patients in
the pandemic period (mean age = 70.4 years; 54% female; P = 0.287 for age and P
= 0.962 for sex, respectively). The combined rate of intraprocedural and
postprocedural serious complications (ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage,
myocardial infarction or death) was 7.1%. Eight strokes occurred, and one
patient with a postprocedural ischemic stroke died 11 days after stenting.
Complication rates were similar before and during the pandemic (aOR 1.040, 95%
CI 0.466-2.321). The number of referrals for CEA during the pandemic period
decreased by 50%.
CONCLUSION: In this cohort of consecutive patients undergoing CAS at a Canadian
comprehensive stroke center before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, the rates
of stroke and death were similar to pre-pandemic conditions and were generally
consistent with the published literature.

Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and transit time are essential biomarkers for
assessing brain health. While dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI has been
widely applied to measure these metrics, it is limited in the pediatric
population due to the need for contrast agents. Arterial spin labeling is a
non-invasive and quantitative MR modality, and multi-delay ASL can measure CBF
and transit time simultaneously. Although multi-delay ASL has been used in adult
neuroimaging studies, its application in children requires investigation.
Moyamoya disease, a progressive steno-occlusive cerebrovascular disorder, often
manifests in childhood. In this work, we present a cohort study that examines
multi-delay ASL and DSC MRI to characterize vascular hemodynamics in 22
pediatric patients. We evaluate CBF and transit time in different brain regions
before and after revascularization surgeries. Results show that
revascularization significantly increased CBF by 24% and 7.6%, respectively, as
measured by ASL and DSC; it also significantly decreased transit time by 12% and
15%, indicating improved hemodynamics and metabolism. ASL and DSC results also
showed significantly positive correlations in all brain regions. Thus,
revascularization improved hemodynamics in pediatric moyamoya patients and shows
that multi-delay ASL can effectively characterize CBF and transit time in the
pediatric population.

BACKGROUND: Accurate determination of stroke etiology is essential for effective
secondary stroke prevention, yet 25% to 40% of ischemic strokes are classified
as cryptogenic. Patent foramen ovale (PFO), a common finding in cryptogenic
stroke, elevates the risk of strokes. However, underuse of diagnostic practices
may lead to underdiagnosis of PFO, missing opportunities for
guideline-recommended PFO closures and preventable recurrent strokes. This study
estimates the value of improving testing for PFO among patients with cryptogenic
stroke in the US.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted, employing a hybrid model
including a decision tree and a Markov model to assess health outcomes and
economic impacts from a US payor perspective over a life-time horizon. The model
compared two PFO testing scenarios: the Current Diagnostic Scenario (54%
testing) and Optimal PFO Diagnostics (100% testing). The decision tree evaluated
diagnostic pathways for PFO (TTE, TEE, TCD), while the Markov model simulated
patient progression through various health states (recurrent ischemic stroke,
TIA, and death). Cost-effectiveness was determined using the incremental
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $75,000
per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY).
RESULTS: In a simulated cohort of 1,000 patients, increasing the diagnostic
testing rate for PFO from 54% to 100% is expected to prevent 63 recurrent
strokes, resulting in 23 life years saved and 286 QALYs gained. This led to
cost-savings of $1.9 million for payors, indicating a dominant economic position
(ICER = -$6,770/QALY). The model estimated screening four patients would lead to
identifying and closing one PFO, while screening seven would prevent one
recurrent stroke. Thorough sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of
these findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Improving PFO diagnostic testing among patients with cryptogenic
stroke is projected to result in improved health outcomes for patients, while
yielding cost-savings for US payors, underscoring the importance of adhering to
PFO diagnostic guidelines.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk of epilepsy associated with stroke in a
community-based cohort, with consideration of stroke type, number, and severity.
METHODS: Data from 15,100 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study
participants without stroke at baseline (1987-1989) were analyzed through
12/31/2022. Adjudicated stroke events were modeled as time-varying exposures.
Epilepsy was defined using International Classification of Diseases Ninth/Tenth
Revisions codes. Adjusted Fine and Gray proportional hazards models were used to
estimate the risk of epilepsy associated with stroke.
RESULTS: At baseline, the mean age of participants was 54 years, 55% were
female, and 26% were of Black race. Over a median of 27 years, 1553 incident
all-cause strokes occurred. The risk of epilepsy was higher among individuals
with versus without incident stroke (HR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.50-2.04). There was
evidence for interaction by age (p-interaction = 0.03) whereby the risk of
epilepsy associated with stroke was higher among individuals with younger versus
older baseline age. Compared to no stroke, the point estimate for the risk of
epilepsy associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage (HR = 2.94, 95% CI = 1.67-5.17)
was higher than that for the risk of epilepsy associated with ischemic stroke
(HR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.40-1.94) and hemorrhagic stroke (HR = 1.47, 95%
CI = 0.95, 2.27). The risk of epilepsy was similar by the number of incident
strokes but was greater with increasing ischemic stroke severity.
INTERPRETATION: The risk of epilepsy was increased after an incident stroke.
This work identifies high-risk subgroups, including younger individuals,
individuals with subarachnoid hemorrhage, and individuals with more severe
ischemic strokes, who may benefit from closer clinical monitoring for
seizures/epilepsy after a stroke.

Inflammation, and particularly microglial cells, has become a central feature in
Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology. The transient receptor potential melastatin
2 (TRPM2) is a calcium-permeable nonselective channel involved in the
pathological mechanism of several inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.
However, the role of TRPM2 in inflammation and microglial activation in the
context of PD remains unclear. Here, we combined both in vivo and in vitro PD
models to investigate that question. Male and female TRPM2 partial and complete
knockout mice were submitted to the 6-hydroxidopamine mouse model of PD. We
assessed microglia and lysosome-associated protein (CD68) density levels,
microglial morphology and cluster classification, CD68 area in individual
microglial cells, and the protein levels of six different cytokines in the
substantia nigra pars compacta and the striatum. Our results indicate that TRPM2
deletion reduced microglial density, rescued its morphology, decreased CD68
staining area within microglia, and lowered pro-inflammatory cytokines levels in
both male and female mice. To better understand TRPM2 involvement in PD
pathology, we selectively knocked-down TRPM2 in neurons, microglia, or both
cells in a human neuron-microglia co-culture PD model. An improvement in cell
viability and a decrease in cell death were observed across the different
experimental approaches. Lastly, TRPM2 deletion revealed reduced microglial
phagocytosis and decreased expression of inflammation-related molecules. For the
first time, we demonstrated that TRPM2 is a critical mediator of microglial
function in the context of PD. Thus, this study suggests that TRPM2 inhibition
may offer a novel therapeutic target for PD modification.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety of the Sentinel
Cerebral Embolic Protection Device (CEPD) during transcatheter aortic valve
replacement (TAVR). This study is a subgroup analysis of the Chinese Registry of
moderate to severe valvular heart disease (CREDIT), which has been registered at
the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2300075006).
METHODS: Patients undergoing TAVR with the Sentinel CEPD from October 2023 to
September 2024 were retrospectively enrolled. A total of 80 patients were
included, with a median age of 72 (68, 76) years, including 52 males (65.0%) and
28 females (35.0%), 62 patients (77.5%) with tricuspid valves, and 18 (22.5%)
with bicuspid valves; 34 patients (42.5%) with type Ⅰ aortic arch, 24 patients
(30.0%) with type Ⅱ aortic arch, 12 patients (15.0%) with type Ⅲ aortic arch,
and 10 patients (12.5%) with bovine-type aortic arch. Clinical data of the
patients were summarized and analyzed. The primary endpoints were success rate
of Sentinel CEPD implantation, as well as all-cause death, symptomatic stroke,
transient ischemic attack, and Sentinel CEPD access vessel complications during
hospitalization and within 30 days postoperatively.
RESULTS: In the 80 patients, Self-expanding valves were used in 68 cases (85.0%)
and balloon-expandable valves in 12 cases (15.0%). Seventy-nine patients (98.8%)
successfully underwent TAVR with Sentinel CEPD deployment. 98.8% (79/80)
successful CEPD deployment. Macroscopically visible debris was captured in 93.8%
(75/80) by filters of Sentinel CEPD. Although the procedure time for Sentinel
CEPD placement was slightly longer in patients with bovine aortic arch, there
was no statistically significant difference in deployment time among different
aortic arch types (P>0.05). During hospitalization and within 30 days
postoperatively, only one case of transient ischemic attack occurred, there was
no all-cause mortality, symptomatic stroke, or access-site vascular
complications related to the Sentinel CEPD observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The Sentinel CEPD demonstrates high feasibility across aortic arch
types, potential efficacy in embolic capture, and excellent safety in TAVR.

PURPOSE: Patients with acquired brain injuries (ABI) and severe traumatic
injuries face many persisting and overlapping injury-related consequences.
Despite a growing number of self-management (SM) interventions targeting these
conditions, no comprehensive reviews exist. This scoping review aims to map the
existing SM interventions across these injury populations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL,
PubMed) were systematically searched. Studies were included if they adhered to
the operational definition by Jonkman et al. and targeted adults with ABI and
traumatic injuries.
RESULTS: A total of 43 studies were included. Most interventions targeted stroke
and spinal cord injuries. The key ingredients were psychoeducation, goal
setting, and training in self-management skills. Most interventions were
conducted in hospitals by healthcare personnel in the chronic post-injury phase.
A considerable variation of reported effects was observed. Additionally,
Bandura's social cognitive theory was frequently applied as a theoretical
background.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant lack of SM interventions for multiple/major trauma
and burns was identified. Many studies were poorly described and did not
indicate how the interventions were tailored to the patients, and the effects
were inconsistent. However, the findings suggest that SM ingredients are
applicable to both ABI and traumatic injury populations in clinical settings.
Plain Language Summary: Patients with acquired brain injuries and traumatic
injuries to other parts of the body face long-lasting health issues and have
many unmet healthcare needs requiring day-to-day self-management.There is
evidence supporting the implementation of self-management interventions at all
stages post-injury.Despite evidence supporting the use of goal setting, action
planning, and tailoring interventions to patients’ needs as cornerstones of
self-management programmes, a significant proportion of the reviewed
interventions did not include these elements.We recommend that clinicians tailor
self-management interventions to meet condition-specific needs and incorporate
goal setting and action planning to empower patients to manage their conditions
effectively.

BACKGROUND: We investigated the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and related
comorbidities including cardiovascular disease (CVD), and mortality, based on
changes in metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).
METHODS: We analyzed data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service for
individuals aged ≥ 20 years. MASLD was defined as a fatty liver index (FLI), a
prediction formula based on metabolic parameters, with a cutoff of ≥ 60. FLI
measurements were compared within each individual over a 2 years period. Based
on changes in FLI between two health checkups, individuals were classified into
four categories; never MASLD (FLI consistently < 60), incident MASLD (FLI < 60
to ≥ 60), regressed MASLD (≥ 60 to < 60), and persistent MASLD (FLI
consistently ≥ 60). The primary outcome was T2DM occurrence in the general
population and myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, heart failure (HF)
and mortality events in individuals with preexisting T2DM with adjustment for
age, sex, smoking, alcohol drinking, and regular exercise.
RESULTS: In 4,397,808 individuals without T2DM, 229,475 (5.2%) developed T2DM
during a median follow-up period of 7.3 years. The risk of incident T2DM was the
highest in individuals with persistent MASLD compared to those who never had
MASLD (HR = 5.28, 95% CI = 5.22-5.34). Individuals with incident or regressed
MASLD also had increased risk of developing T2DM (HR = 3.30, 95% CI = 3.25-3.35
for incident MASLD, HR = 2.87, 95% CI = 2.82-2.92 for regressed MASLD). In a
cohort of 636,520 individuals with preexisting T2DM followed for a median of 6.2
years, those with persistent MASLD had a higher risk of HF (HR = 1.28, 95%
CI = 1.25 to 1.32), MI (HR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.20), stroke (HR = 1.14,
95% CI = 1.09 to 1.19) and all-cause mortality (HR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.09-1.14)
compared to individuals who never had MASLD. Similarly, both incident and
regressed MASLD were associated with an increased risk for HF, MI, stroke and
all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Persistent MASLD is associated with an increased risk of incident
T2DM, and further elevates the risk of CVD, and mortality among individuals with
T2DM. Even individuals with incident or regressed MASLD exhibit an increased
risk of these adverse outcomes compared to those who never had MASLD.

BACKGROUND: Nurse education can assist in developing comprehensive stroke care.
This study aimed to design and validate a comprehensive educational program for
stroke nursing care.
METHODS: This study employed a mixed-methods approach, emphasizing four of the
six steps in Kern's model of educational program development (needs assessment,
initial design, goals and specific objectives, and educational strategy). It was
conducted at Shohadaye Tajrish, Loghman-e Hakim, and Imam Hossein Hospitals in
Tehran during 2023-2024. The initial phase consisted of a comprehensive needs
assessment, a literature review, in-depth interviews with twenty nurses and
patients, a careful review of patient documents and medical records, as well as
direct observations of patient care. The interviews were analyzed with MAXQDA 20
software using the conventional content analysis method. Validation was
conducted through two Delphi rounds, with an agreement level of more than 70%
based on the frequency of responses in each round.
RESULTS: Through the Delphi method, twenty experts participated in the
evaluation and validation process. In the first round of Delphi, 30 learning
topics achieved appropriate consensus (mean scores ranging from 2.33 to 3.55),
while 2 topics (applying basic nursing concepts in patient care and providing
nursing care based on the nursing process) were eliminated due to inappropriate
consensus (mean scores ranging from 1 to 2.32). In the second Delphi round, the
validation of the remaining 30 items was reexamined, which obtained an
appropriate consensus. In the first round of the Delphi study, a significant
Kendall's coefficient of concordance was observed (Kendall's W = 0.735,
χ²=30.524, p < 0.01); however, after removing two items in the second round,
this coefficient improved, indicating stronger agreement among the participants
(Kendall's W = 0.755, χ²=31.624, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: This study developed and validated an educational program focused on
professional nursing care for stroke patients, recognizing the critical need for
continuous education in the neurology department to update nurses' knowledge and
skills with the most current care methods and information.

OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the effects of different modes of
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on depression in post-stroke
depression (PSD) patients using the network meta-analysis method.
METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, Wanfang Data, CNKI,
VIP, and CBM were searched for randomized controlled trials on rTMS for PSD from
the time the database was constructed until April 20th, 2024. Two researchers
independently conducted screenings to extract the relevant literature. The
meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4.1 software. Network meta-analysis
of depression scores was performed using Stata 17.0 software and R 4.4.1
software.
RESULTS: Twelve studies involving four different rTMS modalities were included.
The results of the meta-analysis revealed that rTMS significantly improved
depression (SMD = -1.47, 95% CI [-1.97, -0.97]) and activity of daily living
(ADL) (SMD = 0.78, 95% CI [0.52, 1.04]) in patients with PSD. The follow-up
results revealed that rTMS significantly improved depression in the long term
(SMD = -1.74, 95% CI [-2.32, -1.17]). The results of the network meta-analysis
revealed that dual-rTMS (SMD = -2.33, 95% CI [-3.16, -1.50]), HF-rTMS (SMD =
-1.62, 95% CI [-2.11, -1.13]), iTBS (SMD = -1.57, 95% CI [-2.56, -0.57]), and
LF-rTMS (SMD = -0.80, 95% CI [-1.36, -0.23]) significantly improved depression
compared with sham stimulation. The SUCRA values in descending order were
dual-rTMS (95.9%) > HF-rTMS (65.0%) > iTBS (61.9%) > LF-rTMS (27.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: Twenty minutes of 4-week dual-rTMS on the DLPFC of PSD patients may
produce better therapeutic effects. High-quality, large-sample, standardized RCT
trials can be conducted to further test the scientific validity of the findings.

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with
multiorgan involvement, including the central nervous system. Neuropsychiatric
manifestations (NPSLE) are observed in a significant proportion of patients and
may include ischemic strokes, often related to antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)
or small vessel vasculitis. We report the case of a 38-year-old woman who
presented to the emergency department with acute dysarthria and a history of
fever. Brain imaging demonstrated multiple subacute ischemic lesions affecting
the bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles and frontal regions, and diffuse
leukoencephalopathy. Laboratory investigations revealed high-titer antinuclear,
anti-dsDNA, anticardiolipin antibodies, and lupus anticoagulant. The overall
clinical, radiological, and immunological profile was consistent with
neuropsychiatric SLE. The possible underlying causes of ischemic events were
antiphospholipid syndrome and small vessel vasculitis. This case highlights the
importance of considering NPSLE in the differential diagnosis of diseases
involving bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles. Early recognition and therapy
of NPSLE are crucial for improving outcomes in this complex clinical scenario.

The brain barrier system, including the choroid plexus, meninges and brain
vasculature, regulates substrate transport and maintains differential protein
concentrations between blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Aging and
neurodegeneration disrupt brain barrier function, but proteomic studies of the
effects on blood-CSF protein balance are limited. Here we used SomaScan
proteomics to characterize paired CSF and plasma samples from 2,171 healthy or
cognitively impaired older individuals from multiple cohorts, including the
Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium. We identified proteins with
correlated CSF and plasma levels that are produced primarily outside the brain
and are enriched for structural domains that may enable their transport across
brain barriers. CSF to plasma ratios of 848 proteins increased with aging in
healthy control individuals, including complement and coagulation proteins,
chemokines and proteins linked to neurodegeneration, whereas 64 protein ratios
decreased with age, suggesting substrate-specific barrier regulation. Notably,
elevated CSF to plasma ratios of peripherally derived or vascular-associated
proteins, including DCUN1D1, MFGE8 and VEGFA, were associated with preserved
cognitive function. Genome-wide association studies identified genetic loci
associated with CSF to plasma ratios of 241 proteins, many of which have known
disease associations, including FCN2, the collagen-like domain of which may
facilitate blood-CSF transport. Overall, this work provides molecular insight
into the human brain barrier system and its disruption with age and disease,
with implications for the development of brain-permeable therapeutics.

The brain's functional architecture is shaped by electrophysiological
interactions between its components, encompassing both cortical and subcortical
structures. In this study, we provide an atlas of electrophysiological causal
connections across 4,864 brain sites in 27 human participants using repeated
single-pulse electrical stimulations and recordings with intracranial electrodes
implanted in cortical regions and multiple thalamic nuclei. We show distinct
spectral signatures elicited by perturbations of specific brain areas.
Identified features of causal connectivity exhibited highly organized yet
distinct patterns, indicating that each feature may correspond to a separate
mode of information transmission across brain regions. Notably, we report a new
waveform with unique temporal and spatial characteristics specifically linked to
thalamic stimulations, namely delayed-onset theta oscillations in both
ipsilateral and contralateral cortical regions. These findings contribute to a
more detailed understanding of the human brain's functional architecture and
offer valuable data for the development of biologically informed computational
models.

The increasing global cost of fossil fuels and growing environmental concerns
have accelerated the search for sustainable energy alternatives, positioning
bioethanol as a promising renewable fuel for spark-ignition (SI) engines. This
study uniquely integrates ethanol-petrol blends (E0, E10, E20, and E30) with
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to address critical gaps in predictive
modeling and fuel optimization. Experimental tests were conducted on a
single-cylinder, four-stroke SI engine under constant load conditions, capturing
data on engine speed, mass flow rate, combustion efficiency, peak cylinder
pressure, brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC), and exhaust gas temperature. A
feed-forward backpropagation ANN model was developed using 75% of the collected
data for training and 25% for validation, achieving high predictive accuracy
with R2 values exceeding 0.98 for most parameters. Results showed that E30
improved combustion efficiency by 12.5% compared to E0 at 1500 RPM and reduced
BSFC by 22% in the 2000-2500 RPM range, while maximum cylinder pressure
increased with RPM but remained slightly lower for higher ethanol blends due to
ethanol's cooling effect. By effectively predicting performance metrics across a
broad RPM range (1500-3500), the ANN model reduces reliance on extensive
experimental testing and offers a scalable approach for optimizing fuel-blending
strategies, thereby supporting the transition to cleaner, more efficient energy
systems.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of motion artifacts and the factors
associated with them in a cohort of suspected stroke patients, and to determine
their impact on diagnostic accuracy for both AI and radiologists.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study included brain
MRI scans of consecutive adult suspected stroke patients from a
non-comprehensive Danish stroke center between January and April 2020. An expert
neuroradiologist identified acute ischemic, hemorrhagic, and space-occupying
lesions as references. Two blinded radiology residents rated MRI image quality
and motion artifacts. The diagnostic accuracy of a CE-marked deep learning tool
was compared to that of radiology reports. Multivariate analysis examined
associations between patient characteristics and motion artifacts.
RESULTS: 775 patients (68 years ± 16, 420 female) were included. Acute ischemic,
hemorrhagic, and space-occupying lesions were found in 216 (27.9%), 12 (1.5%),
and 20 (2.6%). Motion artifacts were present in 57 (7.4%). Increasing age (OR
per decade, 1.60; 95% CI: 1.26, 2.09; p < 0.001) and limb motor symptoms (OR,
2.36; 95% CI: 1.32, 4.20; p = 0.003) were independently associated with motion
artifacts in multivariate analysis. Motion artifacts significantly reduced the
accuracy of detecting hemorrhage. This reduction was greater for the AI tool
(from 88 to 67%; p < 0.001) than for radiology reports (from 100 to 93%;
p < 0.001). Ischemic and space-occupying lesion detection was not significantly
affected.
CONCLUSION: Motion artifacts are common in suspected stroke patients,
particularly in the elderly and patients with motor symptoms, reducing accuracy
for hemorrhage detection by both AI and radiologists.
KEY POINTS: Question Motion artifacts reduce the quality of MRI scans, but it is
unclear which factors are associated with them and how they impact diagnostic
accuracy. Findings Motion artifacts occurred in 7% of suspected stroke MRI
scans, associated with higher patient age and motor symptoms, lowering
hemorrhage detection by AI and radiologists. Clinical relevance Motion artifacts
in stroke brain MRIs significantly reduce the diagnostic accuracy of human and
AI detection of intracranial hemorrhages. Elderly patients and those with motor
symptoms may benefit from a greater focus on motion artifact prevention and
reduction.

BACKGROUND: Stroke remains a leading global cause of disability and mortality
with over 100 million patients affected worldwide. Its incidence has risen in
recent decades, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), due to
limited education, healthcare, and effective prevention measures. This study
investigates the association between ethnicity and outcomes of stroke in Qatar,
a country with a heterogeneous population.
METHODS: Data from 18,174 stroke patients admitted to Hamad General Hospital
from 2014 to 2024 were analyzed. We assessed patient characteristics, stroke
types, comorbidities, and outcomes using the NIH Stroke Scale and modified
Rankin Scale (mRS).
RESULTS: There were significant ethnic differences in stroke presentation and
outcomes. Middle Easterns were older (59.7 ± 14.2) than South East Asian
(50.1 ± 11.7) and Far Eastern (47.5 ± 9.85) patients; p < 0.001. Middle Eastern
patients had a higher prevalence of stroke risk factors (diabetes, hypertension,
obesity) and stroke mimics (39.8%) than Southeast Asian (21.7%) and Far Eastern
(27.7%) patients (p < 0.0001). Far Eastern patients demonstrated a higher
incidence (17.6%) of intracerebral hemorrhage compared to Middle Easterns (6.2%)
and East Asians (10.6%); p < 0.0001. However, ischemic stroke was more common
among Southeast Asians (58.6%) than Middle Eastern (43.8%) and Far Eastern
(44.4%) patients; p < 0.0001. Lastly, there were significant differences in
outcomes as measured by mortality and the mRS.
CONCLUSION: There are significant ethnic differences in stroke presentation,
management, and outcomes in Qatar, some of which may reflect underlying
disparities driven by social and structural inequities. While genetic
differences play a role, early management of vascular risk factors is a crucial,
preventable measure to reduce stroke burden in LMICs and improve health

The safety of XBB.1.5-containing COVID-19 mRNA vaccines warrants investigation.
We assessed the relative risk of 15 adverse events following the XBB.1.5
vaccination using a self-controlled case series study design with data from the
National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) from September 11, 2023, to June 1,
2024 in the USA. Based on a baseline population of 244,494 patients, adverse
events included Guillain-Barré syndrome, seizure, non-hemorrhagic stroke and
transient ischemic attack, hemorrhagic stroke, narcolepsy or cataplexy,
anaphylaxis, acute myocardial infarction, myo/pericarditis, coagulopathy,
multisystem inflammatory syndrome, Bell's palsy, transverse myelitis,
appendicitis, pulmonary embolism, and encephalitis. We found an association
between vaccination and anaphylaxis (IRR [95% CI]: day 0-17.35 [9.32-30.03], day
1-9.35 [5.12-15.95], day 2-6.20 [3.40-10.57], <20 patients in each risk period).
No other outcomes showed significantly increased risk following vaccination. Our
results contribute to the safety profile evaluation for XBB.1.5-containing
COVID-19 mRNA vaccines utilizing N3C big data.

This paper addresses a critical challenge in the design of MEMS actuators: the
rejection of out-of-plane motion, specifically along the Z-axis, which can
severely impact the precision and performance of these micro-actuation systems.
In many MEMS applications, unwanted out-of-plane displacement can lead to
reduced accuracy in tasks such as optical steering, micro-manipulation, and
scanning applications. In response to these limitations, this paper proposes a
novel design technique that effectively rejects Z-axis motion by transforming
the motion of the micro stage along the Z-axis into equivalent displacements
between pairs of points on cantilevers. These point pairs are founded exhibiting
variable common-mode and differential-mode motion characteristics, depending on
whether the stage is undergoing in-plane (X/Y) or out-of-plane (Z)
displacements. By connecting these point pairs with rods, differential motion
between the points in the pairs is suppressed, reducing unwanted out-of-plane
motion significantly. We provide a detailed analysis of this design methodology
and present a practical application in the form of an electromagnetic large
displacement MEMS actuator. This actuator undergoes a complete
design-simulation-manufacturing-testing cycle, where the effectiveness of the
Z-axis motion rejection structure is systematically evaluated, and compared
against traditional designs. Experimental results reveal a significant
improvement in performance, with static and dynamic travel ranges reaching
±60 μm and ±400 μm, respectively. Moreover, the Z-axis stiffness was enhanced by
68.5%, which is more than five times the improvement observed in the X/Y axes'
stiffness. These results highlight the potential of the proposed method to
provide a robust solution for out-of-plane motion suppression in MEMS actuators,
offering improved performance without compromising other critical parameters
such as displacement and actuation speed.

Stroke is influenced by numerous factors, both modifiable and non-modifiable.
Among these, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) serves as a prognostic
biomarker in cardiovascular diseases and, within this context, in neurological
conditions like stroke.To determine whether an association exists between GGT
and both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes.A systematic and comprehensive
literature search was conducted across 5 databases, encompassing studies
published from their inception to January 28, 2024, following a population,
exposure, comparator, outcome, and study (PECOS) framework. Ten primary studies
meeting the eligibility criteria were selected.Our findings, based on a
meta-analysis of the ten studies, indicate an increased risk of ischemic and
hemorrhagic strokes in patients with elevated GGT levels, after excluding
outliers. The analysis demonstrated a significant association, with a relative
risk of 1.42 (95%CI: 1.01-1.99; I2 = 19%) for hemorrhagic stroke and 1.22
(95%CI: 1.10-1.36; I2 = 49%) for ischemic stroke.Our study reveals an elevated
risk of stroke in patients with high GGT levels, demonstrating a 42% higher
likelihood of hemorrhagic stroke and a 22% increased risk of ischemic stroke.

The rates of complications after major abdominal surgeries remain high, despite
the advances in pre- and postoperative care and surgical techniques. In these
cases, neurological disorders mainly include stroke and delirium, with a high
increase of morbidity. Ataxia is rarely a consequence of abdominal procedures
like, more often being related to long-term complications of bariatric surgery
due to chronic vitamin deficiency.To describe seven cases of ataxia following
major abdominal surgeries and propose a prophylactic approach.A retrospective
case series in which medical records of patients from the Ataxia Unit of
Universidade Federal de São Paulo were evaluated from January 2007 to August
2024. We identified seven patients who developed acute cerebellar ataxia after
gastrointestinal surgery. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, neuroimaging, and
treatment data were extracted. Descriptive statistics was used to summarize
findings.There were two cases that evolved with neurological improvement, and
five remained with severe cerebellar ataxia. Brain imaging showed cerebellar
atrophy in three patients and signs of Wernicke encephalopathy in two.This case
series describes an unusual form of acute ataxia with poor outcomes, possibly
related to complications from major abdominal surgery. Early intervention and
prophylactic supplementation with vitamins B1 and B12 in patients receiving TPN
should be considered to avoid such severe neurological complications.

Acute ischemic stroke leads to rapid and progressive neuronal losses. Early
revascularization with thrombolytics and/or endovascular thrombectomy plays an
important role in salvaging brain infarction. Currently, alteplase and
tenecteplase are approved thrombolytics for the treatment of acute ischemic
stroke, whereas favorable outcomes of reteplase have recently been reported in a
phase 3 clinical trial. These thrombolytics share common and distinct
pharmacological characteristics, which contribute to their efficacy and safety
in patients. In this review, biological profiles of alteplase, tenecteplase, and
reteplase, including their advantages versus disadvantages in acute ischemic
stroke, are discussed. Tenecteplase has high fibrin specificity, increased
resistance to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), wider
concentration-response curve, and less off-target activities, which support its
efficacy with low incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH).
Reteplase greatly penetrates into the clot with prolonged retention, generating
durable clot lysis. This activity might be associated with its excellent
clinical outcomes in patients, although reteplase is sensitive to PAI-1.
Notably, reteplase and alteplase produce off-target activities by inducing
hypofibrinogenemia and hypoplasminogenemia, which may increase risk of
hemorrhagic transformation. Moreover, orolingual angioedema is a
life-threatening complication of all thrombolytics. Mechanistically, an increase
in plasmin by thrombolytics leads to bradykinin generation. In addition, plasmin
activates mast cell degranulation (e.g., histamine release). Together, these
biopharmacological data of thrombolytics promote insights into their clinical
outcomes, and might provide comprehensive bases for future research.

BACKGROUND: Malignant cerebral edema (MCE) following basilar artery occlusion
(BAO) thrombectomy is a critical, yet understudied, complication.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence, predictors, and clinical impact of MCE
in patients with BAO after endovascular thrombectomy (EVT).
METHODS: In this retrospective analysis of the national multicenter PERSIST
Registry (2422 patients with BAO treated with EVT recruited from 65 Chinese
centers, 2015-2022), MCE was defined as Jauss score ≥4 on follow-up imaging.
Multivariable logistic regression identified predictors of MCE and its
association with 90-day outcomes. A favorable outcome was defined as achieving a
modified Rankin Scale score of 0-3 at 90 days.
RESULTS: A total of 1883 patients who met the eligibility requirements were
included. MCE occurred in 39.6% (746/1883) of patients. Independent predictors
included admission systolic blood pressure ≥160 mm Hg (aOR=1.26, 95% CI 1.02 to
1.54), prolonged procedure time (aOR=1.01, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.01), BATMAN score ≥7
(aOR=0.68, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.84), and vertebral V4 occlusion (vs proximal BA:
aOR=0.68, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.89). Successful reperfusion reduced MCE risk
(aOR=0.57, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.75). Diabetes mellitus exhibited an inverse
association (aOR=0.78, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.99). MCE predicted lower odds of
favorable outcome (aOR=2.41, 95% CI 1.94 to 3.01; P<0.001) and higher mortality
(aOR=1.85, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.27; P<0.001) at 90 days.
CONCLUSIONS: MCE complicates 39.6% of patients with BAO after EVT and portends
catastrophic outcomes despite successful recanalization. Shortening the
procedure time, increasing the likelihood of first-pass success, and optimal
admission blood pressure management might be targets to decrease MCE for
patients with BAO undergoing EVT.

BACKGROUND: Clot composition plays a key role in the pathophysiology of Acute
Ischemic Stroke (AIS) and impacts the effectiveness of treatments such as
thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy (MT). Developing an electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) based device to identify clot characteristics could
improve stroke treatment outcomes. This study aims to estimate the red blood
cell (RBC) and platelet content in extracted AIS clots and explore EIS's
relevance to clinically important parameters, including stroke etiology and
First Pass Effect (FPE).
METHODS: A total of 508 clots from 426 MT patients at five stroke centers in
France, Japan, Serbia, and Spain (February 2021-2024) were analyzed in the
Clotbase International Registry. EIS was performed on retrieved clots, followed
by Martius Scarlet Blue staining and CD42b immunohistochemistry. EIS based
models to quantify RBCs and platelets were designed using a development dataset
(n=309), validated on a blinded dataset (n=199), and combined in a full dataset
(n=508). Components (median interquartile range (IQR)) were quantified,
correlating RBC and platelet percentages with impedance and clinical parameters.
RESULTS: Correlations between content as determined by EIS and histology were
validated in a blind dataset for RBCs (r=0.7, P<0.0001) and platelets (r=0.5,
P<0.0001). Similar correlations were observed in the full dataset. Large-artery
atherosclerosis clots had significantly higher RBC (46.0% (25.7-67.7)) and lower
platelet content (31.7% (22.4-42.7)) compared with cardioembolic (RBCs: 34.9%
(14.0-56.2); platelets: 36.5% (26.7-51.0)) and cryptogenic (RBCs: 31.5%
(17.4-63.6); platelets: 37.8% (28.4-50.8)). FPE was associated with
significantly higher RBC (40.0% (25.6-55.4) vs non-FPE: 31.2% (6.6-50.2)) and
lower platelet content (42.0% (32.0-54.0) vs non-FPE: 47.7% (30.6-65.0)),
confirmed by histology.
CONCLUSION: EIS of RBCs and platelets provide an accurate assessment of clot
composition, correlating strongly with histology. EIS holds the potential to
deliver clinically relevant information on clot characteristics at the point of
care.

BACKGROUND: The optimal threshold or range for systolic blood pressure (SBP)
control in patients with successful reperfusion after endovascular thrombectomy
for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) remains undefined. This study investigated
whether SBP within the first 24 hours after successful reperfusion correlates
with functional outcomes in AIS.
METHODS: In this secondary analysis of the ENCHANTED2/MT trial, patients were
categorized into two groups (120-140 mm Hg and 140-180 mm Hg, respectively)
based on achieved SBP within 24 hours after randomization. The primary outcome
was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days. Secondary outcomes
included neurological deterioration at 7 days, major disability (mRS score of
3-5 at 90 days), hospitalization duration, and health-related quality of life
assessed by the three-level EuroQoL 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire
(EQ-5D-3L) at 90 days. Safety outcomes included early neurological decline
(END), 90-day mortality, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and any
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Treatment effects were expressed as ORs with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: A total of 611 patients (363 in the 120-140 mm Hg group and 248 in the
140-180 mm Hg group) were included. The mean (SD) age was 67 (12) years and
37.8% were female. After adjusting for confounders, the 120-140 mm Hg group was
significantly associated with better functional outcomes (mRS: 2 (IQR 1-4) vs 2
(IQR 1-5); adjusted OR 1.54 (95% CI 1.10 to 2.17), P=0.013). Compared with the
140-180 mm Hg group, the 120-140 mm Hg group had lower rates of neurological
deterioration at 7 days (adjusted OR 0.68 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.98), P=0.037) and
90-day mortality (47 (13.0%) vs 53 (21.4%); adjusted OR 0.48 (95% CI 0.27 to
0.86), P=0.013). There were no significant differences between groups in END,
major disability at 90 days, hospitalization duration, EQ-5D-3L score, sICH, or
ICH (all P>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with successful reperfusion after endovascular
thrombectomy, an average SBP within 24 hours of 120-140 mm Hg was associated
with a greater likelihood of functional independence compared with 140-180 mm
Hg.

INTRODUCTION: Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for patients with heart
failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) reduces morbidity and mortality
and remains widely underused. An HFrEF polypill containing all four pillars of
GDMT has been proposed as an implementation strategy to improve GDMT treatment
rates and subsequent patient outcomes. We present the design and protocol for a
proof-of-concept, pilot type I hybrid randomised clinical trial evaluating an
HFrEF polypill compared with usual care among patients with HFrEF in Sri Lanka
to evaluate short-term feasibility.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This multi-centre, open-label, pilot type I hybrid
randomised clinical trial will recruit 40 adults with HFrEF from two public
hospital sites in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Participants will be randomised to an
HFrEF polypill (containing bisoprolol, losartan, eplerenone, and dapagliflozin
in three available strengths) or usual care and followed for 4 weeks. The
primary outcome is feasibility of recruitment measured by recruitment rate and
adherence to study protocols measured by completion rate of study-related
procedures. Other key outcomes include adherence to GDMT and assessment of
serious adverse events among other exploratory outcomes.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the ethics review
committee at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya (Sri Lanka), the
institutional review board at Washington University in St. Louis (United
States), and the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (Sri Lanka). The
findings of this pilot trial will inform the design and implementation of a
future large-scale type I hybrid trial to assess the efficacy and safety of an
HFrEF polypill in improving clinical outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Stroke poses a significant financial and medical burden as it is the
primary cause of death and disability globally. The identification of modifiable
risk factors is crucial in the prevention of stroke. Life's Essential 8 (LE8) is
the most recent indicator of cardiovascular health, but its association with
stroke is unclear.
METHODS: Using information from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey conducted in 2005-2018, we evaluated the relationship between the LE8
score and the self-reported incidence of stroke in adult US citizens aged 20
years or older on a cross-sectional basis. LE8 scores were classified as being
high, moderate or low according to American Heart Association guidelines. The
stroke status was ascertained through self-reporting, and the analysis was
adjusted for potential confounders. In addition, restricted cubic spline (RCS)
analyses were used to further analyse the potential non-linear correlation
between the LE8 score and the risk of stroke.
RESULTS: In our study, a total of 24 851 study participants were included, with
943 strokes and a male prevalence of 48.21%. After adjusting for all covariates,
the odds of stroke were 2.17 (95% CI: 1.41 to 3.33) and 4.81 (95% CI: 3.07 to
7.56) in those with medium and low LE8 scores compared with those with a high
LE8 score, respectively. Both the health behaviour score and the health factor
score exhibit a significant association with stroke risk. RCS further confirmed
that the association was linear. Finally, subgroup analysis has further
confirmed the robustness of the observed associations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our observation suggests an important independent negative
association between LE8 score and stroke risk. This study demonstrates the
utility of LE8 as a public health tool for stroke risk stratification and
emphasises the importance of cardiovascular health in stroke prevention.

RATIONALE: The use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) as stroke prophylaxis
in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) has increased steadily
since the introduction in 2011. In Sweden today, more patients are treated with
DOACs than with warfarin. However, it is not shown that an increased proportion
of DOAC prescriptions correlates to lower event rates of stroke and systemic
embolism.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate whether the increased prescription of
DOACs in Sweden correlates with lower event rates for all-cause stroke, systemic
embolism and bleeding complications, using real-life data for the whole NVAF
population.
DESIGN: Nationwide retrospective register study.
SETTING: Data were obtained from the Swedish National Patient Registry, covering
patients aged 18 years or older with NVAF, between 1 January 2014, and 31
December 2017. Exposure to oral anticoagulants was determined based on
pharmaceutical data, calculating treatment duration by the number of pills
dispensed and the prescribed daily usage rate. Baseline characteristics and
endpoints were collected from hospital administrative registers using
International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10) codes.
PARTICIPANTS: All patients with NVAF were identified using ICD-10 codes during
the study period. Entry criteria included having a first recorded atrial
fibrillation diagnosis after 1 January 2014 or being previously diagnosed with
atrial fibrillation before 2014 but still receiving care after this date.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcomes were event rates (per 100 person-years) of
ischaemic stroke, systemic embolism, all-cause stroke, major bleeding and
intracranial bleeding (including haemorrhagic stroke). Event rates were
calculated and compared across the study period using Cox proportional hazard
RESULTS: In the total NVAF population, the proportional decrease in event rates
(per 100 treatment years) in 2017 compared with 2014 was ischaemic stroke 24%
(1.70-1.30), all-cause mortality 4% (9.40-9.00), all-cause stroke 24%
(2.10-1.60) and all-cause stroke and systemic embolism 23% (2.20-1.70). During
the same time, the proportion of major bleeding and intracranial bleeding rates,
including haemorrhagic stroke, also decreased: 5% (2.00-1.90), 6% (0.68-0.64)
and 17% (0.30-0.25), respectively. DOACs use increased from 4.1% to 28.3% in the
total population and from 22.7% to 60.9% in newly diagnosed patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In the initial years following the introduction when DOAC uptake in
the population was high, an increasing proportion of Swedish NVAF patients
receiving DOACs was accompanied by lower event rates of all-cause stroke and
systemic embolism, ischaemic stroke and all-cause mortality, intracranial
bleeding and major bleeding, highlighting the improved risk-benefit balance of
DOACs in stroke prophylaxis.

INTRODUCTION: Poststroke individuals have a high incidence of falls during the
first months after discharge. The factors contributing to falls in poststroke
patients are multifaceted, with balance deficits being the most prominent.
Fall-related self-efficacy has also been identified as a key factor influencing
the effectiveness of fall prevention interventions. Additionally, family members
play a crucial role in fall prevention by providing support, supervision and
assistance with mobility and daily activities. While previous studies support
the potential benefits of a fall prevention programme for poststroke
individuals, further evidence is needed to confirm their effectiveness. Building
on the positive outcomes of self-management (SM) interventions in reducing falls
across diverse populations, this study aims to evaluate the effects of an
individual and family SM (IFSM) fall prevention programme on balance ability and
fall-related self-efficacy among poststroke individuals.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will be a two-arm, single-blind, pre-post test
randomised controlled trial. The target sample will consist of 60 poststroke
adults with moderate severity and their primary family members. The intervention
group will receive the IFSM fall prevention programme, which consists of 10
weekly sessions. The main components of the programme are exercise, home
environment assessment, assistive technology, medication review and safety
during daily activities. The control group will receive usual care but will not
participate in any specific intervention. Primary outcomes-balance ability and
fall-related self-efficacy-will be assessed at baseline and week 8 after
discharge. Secondary outcomes will include the number of falls and fall-related
injuries.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the Research Ethics
Committees of the Faculty of Nursing, Chiang Mai University and the Affiliated
Hospital of Guizhou Medical University. The results will be disseminated to
poststroke individuals and their families through workshops; to healthcare
professionals via professional training and meetings; and to researchers via
conferences and publications.

BACKGROUND: Multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome (MCS) is a form of severe
hypertriglyceridemia (sHTG) associated with increased risk of acute pancreatitis
and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). We recently reported
suggestive evidence that DNA methylation (DNAm) contribute to the sHTG phenotype
in MCS. While few predictors of acute pancreatitis were previously identified in
MCS, predictors of ASCVD in MCS remain mostly unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To study the factors associated with previous history of ASCVD in MCS
patients.
METHODS: A total of 114 patients with MCS were included in this retrospective
study. Prevalence of ASCVD was determined at the baseline visit and defined as
any atherosclerotic event: angina, myocardial infarction, coronary angioplasty,
coronary bypass surgery, claudication, peripheral angioplasty, peripheral
arterial surgery, transient ischemic attack, stroke, carotid endarterectomy, and
artery stenosis (>50 %). DNAm level at ABCG1 (cg06500161), CPT1A (cg00574958),
and SREBF1 (cg11024682) candidate gene loci was quantified using pyrosequencing
of bisulfite-treated DNA.
RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that age, ABCG1 and SREBF1 DNAm level, and
the presence of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and maximal TG
level > 40 mmol/L were associated with previous history of ASCVD. Multivariate
analysis showed that age (OR 1.11 [1.04-1.18], p = 0.0006), SREBF1 DNAm levels
(OR 1.12 [1.03-1.24], p = 0.01), the presence of a maximal TG level > 40 mmol/L
(OR 0.13 [0.02-0.90], p = 0.04), and obesity (OR 3.32 [1.00-11.19, p = 0.05]
were independently associated with history of ASCVD and explained 44.8 % of the
variability in the prevalence of ASCVD (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: This study shows that SREBF1 DNAm levels are independently
associated with prevalence of ASCVD in MCS patients. It suggests that further
studies of epivariations may contribute to better understand the clinical
heterogeneity seen in MCS patients.

OBJECTIVE: Patients are highly heterogeneous, with varying needs and responses
to treatment. Identifying clinically homogenous patient subgroups is critical to
improve personalized care. Patient records are often heterogeneous, may include
multiple modalities which conventionally require separate data processing
considerations, and are often incomplete, leading to difficulties in identifying
meaningful clusters of patients.
METHODS: We introduce a Med-ROAR, a transformer-based Random Order
AutoRegressive (ROAR) embedding model for medical data. Med-ROAR hierarchically
clusters data by encoding it into hierarchical discrete embeddings using a
modified self-attention operation to facilitate random order mixed modality
autoregressive modeling. This allows the model to accept arbitrary mixes of
record types without special considerations. We compare our method's clustering
effectiveness to standard agglomerative clustering using 147,469 individuals
diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We also evaluate its use on data
with mixed modalities and its resilience to missing information using 50,458
clinical records from Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients which include both
tabular and time-series components.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that Med-ROAR is more likely to discover more cohesive
high-level clusters than distance-based methods like agglomerative clustering.
Our exploratory analysis of the autism data identifies clinically meaningful
patterns of phenotypes within ASD. We identify homogenous, but atypical, patient
subgroups within the ASD population. We also demonstrate Med-ROAR's
effectiveness in clustering patients using mixes of both tabular and time series
clinical records from ICU patients. We demonstrate that Med-ROAR can predict
patient subgroups even using incomplete, preliminary information collected
shortly after admission.
CONCLUSION: Med-ROAR is a flexible hierarchical clustering technique which
learns to cluster patients based on learned high-level semantic similarities
rather than rule-based metrics. It can accept whatever patient data may be
available without modification to the underlying model architecture. The data
modalities which Med-ROAR can accept are primarily constrained by computational
resources, rather than architectural limitations.

BACKGROUND: Although aorta atheroma morphology is associated with acute outcomes
post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), its association with
long-term outcomes post-TAVR remains unknown. This study evaluates the impact of
severe aortic atheroma on long-term outcomes following TAVR.
METHODS: We enrolled 977 patients who underwent TAVR between February 2010 and
May 2019, with available contrast-enhanced computed tomography data. Severe
aortic atheroma was defined as protruding atheroma of ≥3mm thickness with
protruding components, ulcerated atheroma with ulcer-like intimal disruption,
and atheroma of ≥5mm thickness. The primary endpoint was 2-year major adverse
cardiac and cerebrovascular event (MACCE), defined as a composite of
cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and heart failure,
events classified as periprocedural (≤30 days), early (30 days to 1 year), and
late (>1-year post-TAVR).
RESULTS: Patients with severe aortic atheroma (n=274, 28%) had a higher
cumulative incidence of 2-year MACCE than those without (40.6% vs. 28.9%,
log-rank p=0.0002), which was attributed to increased risks of ischemic stroke
(13.8% vs. 6.8%, log-rank p=0.0012) and cardiovascular death (18.6% vs. 10.8%,
log-rank p=0.0009). Severe aortic atheroma was an independent risk factors for
2-year MACCE (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.49, 95% CI, 1.16-1.90). In the
landmark analysis, severe aortic atheroma was independently associated with
periprocedural ischemic stroke and cardiovascular death (aHR, 2.12, 95% CI,
1.15-3.90 and aHR, 3.29, 95% CI, 1.70-6.37, respectively), and late ischemic
stroke (aHR, 3.71, 95% CI, 1.35-10.2).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe aortic atheroma have an increased risk of
2-year MACCE post-TAVR.

&#xD;Brain-computer interface (BCI) training has been shown to be effective for
inducing neural plasticity and for improving motor function in stroke patients.
BCI training could potentially have a positive effect on people with multiple
sclerosis (MS) as well by pairing movement-related brain activity with congruent
afferent feedback from e.g. functional electrical stimulation. In the current
study, the aim was to detect movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) from
single-trial EEG in people with MS across two separate days using different
classifier calibration schemes to estimate the performance of a BCI that can be
used for neurorehabilitation.&#xD;Approach:&#xD;Fifteen individuals with MS
performed 100 wrist movements and 100 ankle movements while continuous EEG was
recorded. Also, idle brain activity was recorded. This was repeated on a
separate day. The data were filtered and divided into epochs containing data
prior to the movement onset. Temporal, spectral and template-matching features
were extracted and classified with a random forest classifier using different
calibration schemes to estimate the performance when training the classifier on
data from the same day and same participant, different day but same participant,
and across different participants.&#xD;Main results:&#xD;Clear MRCPs were
elicited across both recording days, and it was possible to discriminate between
idle activity and movement-related brain activity with accuracies between
~80-90% when training and testing the classifier on data from the same day and
participant. The performance decreased when using data from a separate day but
same participant (~70-80%) or data from separate participants (~70%) for
training the classifier.&#xD;Significance:&#xD;The results showed that it is
feasible for people with MS to use a BCI for inducing neural plasticity.&#xD.

To create educational program for the nursing team regarding appropriate bed
positioning during the flaccid stage of cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs)
METHODS: The chief nursing instructor and rehabilitation department initiated an
educational teaching program that involved ten senior nurses who were given
learning assignments for clinical practice. The ultimate goal was to maintain
joint range of motion to avoid flexion deformity or extension lag in acute
flaccid stage of CVAs. At day 0, day 14, and day 30, the Action Research Arm
Test (ARAT) was utilized to measure the functional outcome RESULTS: The mean
ARAT score was 8.83±4.094 at inclusion, 22.87±6.015 at day 14, and 44.64±3.268
at day 30, (p < 0.001). Patients showed no flexion deformity or extension lag at
the end of the study period CONCLUSION: For CVAs patients, the nursing staff's
daily implementation of proper bed posture was essential for enhancing the
rehabilitation program and optimum functional recovery.

BACKGROUND: Leptomeningeal collaterals (LMCs) carry important prognostic value
for patients with Acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Insulin resistance (IR) is
associated with cardiovascular disease, but its impact on stroke outcomes is
less clear. The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index is a novel, accessible
biomarker for IR. This study aims to evaluate the association between TyG index
and LMCs.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we included patients with internal
carotid artery or middle cerebral artery occlusion and having CTA within 24 h of
symptoms onset. TyG index formula was: ln [triglyceride (mg/dl) × glucose
(mg/dl)]/2. CTA collaterals were classified into symmetrical, malignant, and
other. Hypoperfusion Intensity Ratio (HIR) calculated from CT perfusion (CTP)
was used as secondary marker. We did a multivariate ordinal logistic regression
analysis for collaterals and multi linear regression analysis for HIR.
RESULTS: Of 265 patients, 54.1 % were males, and 45.9 % were females, with a
mean BMI of 28. A total of 219 (82 %) patients received reperfusion therapy,
with 40 % and 74 % patients receiving tPA and EVT, respectively. 39.2 % and
27.2 % of patients had symmetrical and malignant CTA collateral scores,
respectively. TyG index was a significant predictor of malignant CTA collaterals
(β = 2.2, 95 % CI: 1.7 - 2.7) and CTP HIR (β = 0.1, 95 % CI: 0.03-0.14). TyG
> 8.7 had diagnostic accuracy of 0.76 for malignant CTA collaterals.
CONCLUSIONS: IR, as measured by TyG index, is predictive of worse LMCs. TyG is a
promising biomarker with a potential value in predicting stroke outcomes after
reperfusion therapy.

BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated ischemic stroke has a high recurrence rate.
Subcutaneous (SC) heparin therapy is used to prevent this recurrence, but its
long-term efficacy remains unclear. This study evaluated the 180-day effects,
safety, and sustainability of SC heparin treatment in patients with
METHODS: Patients with cancer-associated ischemic stroke who were treated with
unfractionated heparin were retrospectively investigated. Clinical data, such as
D-dimer levels, heparin dosing, and cancer-related information, were collected.
Outcomes assessed over 180 days included recurrent cancer-associated thrombosis
(CAT), mortality, adverse events, and treatment discontinuation.
RESULTS: Five of 100 patients treated with SC heparin experienced recurrence of
CAT (ischemic stroke, four patients; pulmonary embolism, one patient). The
cumulative recurrence rates of CAT were 2.4 % at 30 days and 7.7 % at 90 days,
with no recurrence observed thereafter. At 180 days of follow-up, 19 patients
survived without CAT recurrence and one patient was completely cured of cancer
through surgery, while 29 patients died of cancer without recurrence of CAT.
This finding suggested that approximately half of the patients benefited from SC
heparin therapy. Adverse events such as major bleeding were observed in 16
patients, leading to the discontinuation of treatment. Additionally, treatment
was discontinued for various reasons such as psychological distress in 30
patients. D-dimer levels at the time of the initial cancer-associated ischemic
stroke tended to be higher in patients with recurrence than in those without
recurrence, but this was not significant. No recurrence of CAT was observed in
patients with pancreatic cancer, likely due to early cancer-related mortality.
CAT recurrence and adverse event rates were not significantly different by
cancer stage (stage IV vs. other stages) or between the fixed dose and adjusted
dose heparin groups.
CONCLUSIONS: SC heparin therapy effectively maintained a low recurrence rate of
CAT for 180 days, and may have contributed to preserving functionality and
quality of life of the patients. Recurrence and adverse events were primarily
observed within the first 90 days. However, challenges related to long-term SC
heparin therapy remain. To improve treatment sustainability, comprehensive
palliative care that addresses physical discomfort and psychological distress is
essential. This study suggests the potential long-term benefits and limitations
of SC heparin therapy and highlights the need for future long-term prospective
studies comparing this therapy with alternative anticoagulation strategies.

often encounter challenges related to output efficiency and portability. This
paper presents the design, modeling, and evaluation of an innovative wrist
rehabilitation robot that employs two double-layer lattice structure pneumatic
actuators (DLSPAs) to enhance efficiency. Key parameters of these DLSPAs are
optimized through a mathematical model, with calibration experiments indicating
that the discrepancy between actual and predicted values remains within 4% of
the DLSPAs' maximum output force, thereby validating the model's accuracy.
Furthermore, the DLSPAs achieve an end output force of 27.02 N, marking a 156%
increase compared to single-layer lattice structure pneumatic actuators (SLSPAs)
and underscoring the structural advantages of the design. To evaluate the
clinical efficacy of the wrist rehabilitation robot, trials were conducted with
8 individuals post-stroke. Results demonstrate that, with robotic assistance,
participants' lifting force reached 4.85 N and 5.11 N in dorsal extension and
palmar flexion, respectively, with corresponding angular movements of
36.40${}^{\circ }$ and 38.36${}^{\circ }$. These findings suggest that the
lattice-structured soft wrist rehabilitation robot offers substantial potential
for effective assisted rehabilitation training.

Approximately 60-70% of people with stroke experience a mild incident. However,
mild stroke can significantly impact daily life for these individuals and their
significant others. Reviews suggest that the use of information and
communication technology (ICT) can add value to the existing stroke
rehabilitation. The purpose of the current study was to co-design and evaluate
an ICT-based solution with and for people with mild stroke and their significant
others to support them through the stroke trajectory. Inspired by
experience-based co-design, the study focused on developing an ICT-based
solution in a co-design workshop, testing the prototype in co-design teams, and
pilot testing and evaluating the intervention through interviews with
individuals with mild stroke and their significant others. Through the co-design
process, a prototype was developed and tested. The developed ICT-based solution
offers targeted information and tips for managing mild stroke consequences, such
as concentration issues and fatigue. The evaluation led to the identified four
categories: Diverse ways of using the ICT-based solution, Significant others'
use of information tailored for people with mild strokes and vice versa,
Essential elements related to the usability of the ICT-based solution, and
Suggestions for further development and implementation. The evaluation showed
that the app provided useful information to both participants with stroke and
their significant others, which may have supported their stroke trajectory and
coping abilities. Introducing the app during the hospital stay was beneficial.
Over time, participants valued the app's information as they adapted to living
with mild stroke.
Plain Language Summary: Integrating ICT-based tools, such as the co-designed
app, early in the stroke trajectory is important to support individuals with
mild stroke and their significant others throughout the stroke trajectory.Usable
and relevant ICT solutions can enhance coping abilities, promoting long-term
support beyond the clinical setting.

Specific cell types of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), such as pericytes, can be
infected by HIV-1. Importantly, alterations of the expression of tight junction
protein occludin have been linked to regulation of HIV-1 infection. In the
present study, we hypothesized that occludin can influence HIV-1 infection via
modulating innate immunity responses. Unbiased transcriptome analysis was
conducted on wild type and occludin-silenced primary human blood-brain barrier
pericytes. The role of differentially expressed innate-immunity pathways was
then evaluated in the context of mitochondrial dysfunction and HIV-1 infection.
Using a model of ischemic stroke and occludin-deficient mice, we elucidated the
functional role of occludin in cerebrovascular health in the presence of HIV-1
infection. Occludin silencing resulted in alterations of the gene expression
signatures of IFN-stimulated genes and the antiviral retinoic acid-inducible
gene-1 pathway, which functions as a regulator of the cytoplasmic sensors
upstream of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein. Indeed, we observed
dysfunctional mitochondrial bioenergetics, dynamics, and autophagy following
occludin silencing. Alterations of mitochondrial bioenergetics and innate immune
protection translated into worsened ischemic stroke outcomes in EcoHIV-infected
occludin-deficient mice. Animal studies also confirmed that occludin-/- mice had
higher EcoHIV load in plasma, spleen, and brain. Our results allow for a better
understanding of the molecular mechanisms of viral infection in the brain and
describe a previously unrecognized role of occludin as a key factor in the
control of innate immune responses and mitochondrial dynamics at the blood-brain
barrier level, which influence cerebral vascular disease outcomes such as
ischemic stroke.

BACKGROUND: Anticoagulant therapy with vitamin K antagonists is recommended in
the current guidelines for 3 to 6 months following bioprosthetic valve
replacement. However, in the era of direct oral anticoagulants, there is a
paucity of evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of direct oral
anticoagulants in this patient group.
METHODS: The ENBALV trial (Edoxaban in Anticoagulant Therapy After Surgical
Bioprosthetic Valve Replacement) was an investigator-initiated, phase 3,
randomized, open-label, multicenter study that aimed to evaluate the efficacy
and safety of edoxaban compared with warfarin within 3 months following
bioprosthetic valve replacement at the aortic or mitral position or both. The
primary outcome was stroke or systemic embolism. The secondary outcomes included
major bleeding, intracardiac thrombus, and a composite of stroke, systemic
embolism, or major bleeding. Given the limited study period and the low event
rate of the primary outcome, this study assessed the difference in the point
estimates of the event rate.
RESULTS: Of the 410 enrolled patients, 389 were included in the final analysis
(73±6 years, 56.8% male, 79.4% sinus rhythm; edoxaban group: n=195, warfarin
group: n=194). The primary outcome occurred in 0.5% (n=1) in the edoxaban group,
whereas in 1.5% (n=3) in the warfarin group (risk difference, -1.03% [95% CI,
-4.34 to 1.95%]). Major bleeding occurred in 4.1% (n=8) in the edoxaban group
and in 1.0% (n=2) in the warfarin group (risk difference, 3.07% [95% CI, -0.67
to 7.27%]). No fatal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage was observed in
patients treated with edoxaban, whereas 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage occurred
in the warfarin group. Intracardiac thrombus did not occur in any of the
patients in the edoxaban group, but did occur in 1.0% (n=2) in the warfarin
group.
CONCLUSIONS: Edoxaban is a potential alternative anticoagulant therapy early
after bioprosthetic valve replacement.

Thrombotic complications including myocardial infarction, stroke, venous
thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism are common causes of drug attrition
often discovered at late stages of drug development. Current nonclinical safety
assessments include screening tests that detect hemorrhagic complications but do
not identify conditions signaling a risk of thrombosis. Our study aimed to
identify sensitive tests for detecting prothrombotic imbalance, without overt
thrombosis, for use in early nonclinical drug safety assessments in rodents.
Sprague Dawley rats were administered different doses of thromboplastin or
tranexamic acid to induce variable intensity hypercoagulable or hypofibrinolytic
states, respectively. A panel of functional and quantitative assays measuring
hemostatic proteins and pathways were evaluated, in concert with traditional
coagulation screening tests and blood cell counts. Profound changes were
observed with different patterns of test abnormalities for the different
stimuli. Measurements of D-dimer and thrombin antithrombin complex
concentrations, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and Factor VIIa activity were
among the most sensitive tests of hypercoagulability. In contrast,
hypofibrinolysis was best characterized in a kinetic, turbidimetric assay.
Traditional coagulation screening tests were relatively insensitive, and no
single test defined the cause of prothrombotic imbalance. Our results
demonstrate that customized biomarker panels can detect early drug-induced
prothrombotic states in rats arising from distinct mechanisms.

Bálint Syndrome From Posterior Cerebral Artery Infarctions Case Report.
Leidy L(1), Dickinson A.
(1)Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, VA.
OBJECTIVES: Bálint syndrome is a debilitating, rare neurological condition that
is characterized by a triad of visuospatial distortions: simultanagnosia, optic
ataxia, and oculomotor apraxia. We highlight the pathways involved with
infarction of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA), which may be an important
underlying factor leading to the development of clinical presentations found in
Bálint syndrome.
METHODS: We present a case of a middle-aged patient who presents with Bálint
syndrome following a PCA infarction.
RESULTS: A 49-year-old male bus driver with a recent PCA infarction presented
with all 3 components of Bálint syndrome. His clinical course was notable for
simultanagnosia, optic ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, and a right greater than left
lower visual field deficit. Neuroimaging revealed infarctions in the P1 and
bilateral P2 segments of the posterior cerebral arteries, affecting the
parieto-occipital regions known to underlie visuospatial processing. Laboratory
workup helped exclude opportunistic and systemic causes, supporting a
stroke-related etiology.
CONCLUSIONS: Posterior cerebral artery infarctions may be responsible for the
clinical presentation of Bálint syndrome; however, further investigation into
vascular and neuronal networks underlying the clinical signs and symptoms of
Bálint syndrome is needed.

IMPORTANCE: Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), such as
semaglutide and tirzepatide, provide cardiometabolic benefits to patients with
type 2 diabetes and obesity, but their potential benefits in mitigating
neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of semaglutide and tirzepatide with the
incidence of dementia, Parkinson disease, ischemic stroke, intracerebral
hemorrhage, and all-cause mortality compared with other antidiabetic drugs in
adults with type 2 diabetes and obesity.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed
electronic health record-based data from the TriNetX US network (December 1,
2017, to June 30, 2024) in adults aged 40 years or older with type 2 diabetes
and obesity initiating semaglutide, tirzepatide, or other antidiabetic drugs,
excluding those with prior neurodegenerative or cerebrovascular diseases.
Propensity score matching was used to balance the baseline characteristics.
EXPOSURES: Patients treated with antidiabetic drugs were categorized as GLP-1RA
(semaglutide or tirzepatide) or other antidiabetic drug (biguanides,
sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2
inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, and α-glucosidase inhibitors) users.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the incidence of
neurodegenerative diseases (dementia, Parkinson disease, and mild cognitive
impairment) and cerebrovascular (stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage) diseases,
while the secondary outcome was all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazard
models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs.
RESULTS: A total of 60 860 adults with type 2 diabetes and obesity were
included, with 30 430 each in the GLP-1RA group (mean [SD] age, 57.9 [9.9]
years; 50.2% female) and the other antidiabetic drug group (mean [SD] age, 58.0
[10.8] years; 51.4% female) after propensity score matching. During a 7-year
follow-up, GLP-1RA users had a lower risk of dementia (HR, 0.63; 95% CI,
0.50-0.81), stroke (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70-0.93), and all-cause mortality (HR,
0.70; 95% CI, 0.63-0.78), with no significant differences in the risk of
Parkinson disease or intracerebral hemorrhage. Subgroup analyses revealed
greater benefits in patients aged 60 years or older, women, and patients with a
body mass index of 30 to 40.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, the use of GLP-1RAs semaglutide
and tirzepatide was associated with a lower risk of dementia, stroke, and
all-cause mortality in adults with type 2 diabetes and obesity. These findings
suggest potential neuroprotective and cerebrovascular benefits of GLP-1RAs
beyond glycemic control, warranting further trials to confirm these outcomes.

To investigate the regulation of the GABAergic system and Wnt/β-catenin
signaling pathway in rats with limb spasticity after stroke by Head Acupuncture
therapy and its potential mechanism. A middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
model was established by the thread bolus method, and randomly grouped into a
blank group, a model group, and a needling group, the latter of which received
the intervention of needling at the points of "Hundred Houses" and "Rate Valley"
for 30 min a day for 7 consecutive days. The neurological deficits and muscle
tone of rats were assessed by Zeo Longa score and modified Ashworth score, and
the expression levels of key proteins of the GABAergic system (GAD65, GAD67,
GABA-T, GAT-3, NKCC1) and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway were detected by
immunohistochemistry, real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR and Western blot
and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway key protein expression levels. Head
Acupuncture significantly improved the neurological deficit score and muscle
tone of rats in the model group, decreased the mRNA and protein expression
levels of GABA-T and NKCC1, and significantly up-regulated the expression of
GAD65, GAD67, and GAT-3. In addition, acupuncture promoted the expression of
Wnt7a and β-catenin, and the effect of 7 days of treatment was better than that
of 1 day. Head Acupuncture therapy may exert a therapeutic effect on limb
spasticity after stroke by regulating the balance of the GABAergic system and
activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This provides a new experimental
basis for the application of acupuncture in post-stroke sequelae.Clinical trial

BACKGROUND: Various different technologies have been developed to optimise the
mechanical thrombectomy procedure and first pass recanalisation. We report our
initial experience with the NeVa NET - a novel stent-retriever with built in
distal microfiltration net.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of our prospectively
maintained databases to identify all patients treated with the NeVa NET
4 × 30 mm device. We recorded the baseline demographics, NIHSS, ASPECT score and
clot characteristics, first pass and final eTICI scores, complications and
90 day mRS.
RESULTS: We identified 20 patients (50% male), average age 67.9 ± 16.2 yrs, and
median NIHSS 18 (range 6-29). 30% of patients received tPA. Average clot length
was 21.6 ± 8.9 mm and median ASPECT score 9 (range 5-10). In 18 cases the NeVa
NET could be tracked into position, however, in 2 cases it could not be tracked
into position within the 0,021inch microcatheter. First pass recanalization
(eTICI ≥ 2c) was seen in 94% (n = 17) and the average number of NeVa NET passes
was 1. A final eTICI score of ≥ 2c was achieved in 17 patients (94%). There were
no emboli to new territories. No cases of vessel rupture or dissections occured
due to the NeVa NET. 50% of patients achieved mRS 0-2. SAH was seen in 31.3% and
SICH in 6.3% of the 16 patients for whom a 24 h CT head was available.
CONCLUSION: The NeVa Net stent-retriever is uniquely designed to prevent distal
embolisation and our initial experience demonstrates a very high FPE and mFPE.
We believe this is the first publication on the use of this novel technology and
larger studies are warranted.

PURPOSE: Aneurysm wall enhancement (AWE) is an imaging biomarker that could aid
in risk stratification of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) In this pilot study, we
explored the potential of a radiogenomics approach by combining blood-based
biomarkers and AWE for better risk stratification of IAs.
METHODS: Patient specific vessel wall imaging scans and whole blood samples were
obtained, and IAs were classified as high-risk or low-risk using two different
metrics: symptomatic status (3 symptomatic vs. 13 asymptomatic) and PHASES score
(4 with a high score vs. 12 with a low score). Radiomics features (RFs) were
extracted from the pre- and post-contrast MRI for all IA sac walls, and
significantly different RFs were identified through univariate analysis. RNA
sequencing from whole blood samples for these patients was also performed to
identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between high and low-risk IA
groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering analysis were applied,
using both risk metrics, to evaluate discriminatory power. Lastly, ontological
and correlation analyses were carried out to investigate biological mechanisms
associated with the DEGs.
RESULTS: Our analysis of 16 IAs identified 12 RFs and 97 genes that were
significantly different between symptomatic and asymptomatic IAs (RF:
p-value < 0.05; DEG: fold-change > 2, p-value < 0.01). Examining risk with
respect to PHASES score, we identified 6 significant radiomics features and 38
differentially expressed genes. Through principal component analysis and
clustering analysis, we found that DEGs only and radiogenomics features produced
a better separation between high- and low-risk than RFs alone for both risk
metrics. Furthermore, we found a significant correlation between 7 unique RFs
and 38 DEGs.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that a radiogenomics approach can help in better
risk stratification of IAs.

Hemodialysis removes uremic toxins and excess water and sodium from the blood of
patients with kidney failure. For the last 60 years, this technique has been
extensively improved in order to optimize patient survival and mimimize adverse
events. Indeed, life-threatening complications related to hemodialysis have
become very rare with the use of modern machines and equipment. These
hemodialysis-related serious events that became less frequent include hemolysis,
air embolism, dialyzer reactions and dialysis disequilibrium syndrome. On the
other hand, other medical emergencies are regularly encountered in hemodialysis
units such as arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, epilepsy, trauma,
sepsis, allergic reactions, or bleeding related or not to vascular access.
Cardiac arrest can also occur suddenly or as a result of the severity of medical
events or delay in their management. In fact, patients on hemodialysis have
multiple comorbidities and are subject to common complications that need to be
promptly recognized and timely managed by the dialysis staff. Nephrologists
taking care of these high-risk patients need a practical, efficient approach to
provide care and save lives. Based on the European Resuscitation Council
Guidelines, the Resuscitation Council UK, the American Heart Association, and
the Advanced Trauma Life Support, we review here the current standards of life
support and propose a systematic approach to be used in the hemodialysis
setting, that helps healthcare providers in their assessment and management of
vital emergencies.

BACKGROUND: Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies have proposed integrated
exposure-response models primarily based on North American and European data,
which may not be directly applicable to the Asia-Pacific region. Through a
systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to explore the association between
long-term exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) and mortality in the
Asia-Pacific states.
METHODS: We searched 3 databases (PubMed [n = 8,326], Embase [n = 4,709], and
Cochrane Library [n = 357]) between 1st January 1990 and 31st July 2023. Our
search focused on studies examining the associations between long-term exposure
to PM with an aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and 10 μm (PM₁₀) and
all-cause (or non-accidental) and cause-specific mortality, including
cardiovascular disease (CVD), ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, acute lower
respiratory infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer
deaths in the Asia-Pacific states. We conducted a meta-analysis to pool the
estimates in the studies.
RESULTS: We identified 71 articles investigating the association between
long-term exposure to PM and all-cause and cause-specific mortality. For a 10
μg/m³ increase in PM2.5, the pooled relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence
intervals (CI) for all-cause mortality was 1.11 (95% CI, 1.05-1.17), 1.13 (95%
CI, 1.06-1.21) for CVD, 1.13 (95% CI, 1.02-1.25) for IHD, 1.12 (95% CI,
1.02-1.24) for stroke, and 1.12 (95% CI, 1.08-1.16) for lung cancer. For a 10
μg/m³ increase in PM₁₀, the pooled RR for all-cause mortality was 1.12 (95% CI,
1.00-1.24) and 1.33 (95% CI, 1.28-1.38) for IHD.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis revealed positive associations between long-term
exposure to PM and all-cause and cause-specific mortality for CVD, IHD, stroke,
and lung cancer in the Asia-Pacific states.

Carotid web - a rare cause of ischemic stroke.
[Article in English]
Guňka I, Leško M, Hudák A, Bělobrádek Z, Šimůnek L.
INTRODUCTION: A carotid web is a rare but clinically important cause of
cryptogenic ischemic stroke. It is an atypical form of fibromuscular dysplasia
localized at the carotid bulb. The aim of this paper is to present this
less-known cause of ischemic stroke based on a case study.
CASE REPORT: In a 55-year-old female patient with acute ischemic strok in the
left carotid territory, a carotid web was diagnosed on CT angiography. Other
extracranial or intracranial cerebral arteries showed no stenoses or occlusions.
The patient was initially treated effectively with intravenous thrombolysis. A
follow-up brain MRI revealed a small cortical ischemia and a detailed
cardiological evaluation excluded the cardioembolic etiology of the stroke. As
part of the secondary stroke prevention, the patient was managed with
antiplatelet therapy and underwent an uncomplicated carotid endarterectomy.
During a 10-month follow-up period, there was no recurrence of cerebral
ischemia.
CONCLUSION: Carotid endarterectomy represents a safe and effective method for
treating symptomatic carotid web.

View of current vascular surgery on asymptomatic carotid stenosis.
Vlachovský R, Novotný T, Staffa R.
In recent years, the significant progress in the outcomes of conservative
treatment for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis has sparked
discussions about the most effective invasive treatment. The necessity of such
treatment is still being debated in certain cases. Several studies have already
been conducted to find the most appropriate approach for asymptomatic patients
with carotid stenosis, while others are still randomizing and awaiting results.
A major unanswered question is whether revascularization is more beneficial than
intensive conservative treatment, particularly in view of the lower stroke rates
achieved in recent years without conventional or endovascular intervention. The
long-term goal should be to identify a subset of patients who would benefit from
conservative treatment. In this text, we summarize the issue in the context of
the results of two recently completed pivotal studies.

Extra-intracranial bypass.
Dostál J, Přibáň V, Mraček J.
Extra-intracranial bypass represents a controversial yet significant component
of neurosurgical treatment for cerebrovascular diseases. The indications are
moyamoya dis-ease, steno-occlusive atherosclerotic disease of the internal
carotid artery, acute ischemic stroke, and, more rarely, complex intracranial
aneurysms and skull base tumors. Although historical studies have yielded mixed
results and limited its use, modern diagnostic and surgical techniques are
reopening the path for selective application of bypass in high-risk patients. A
clear indication is the rare moyamoya disease, where bypass is a proven method
for preventing ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes. In patients with symptomatic
chronic internal carotid artery occlusion and exhausted cerebrovascular reserve,
bypass may serve as a potential treatment modality, provided it is carefully
indicated -through comprehensive specialized evaluation. Emergent bypass should
be considered for a narrow group of patients with acute ischemic stroke when
standard treatment fails or is not feasible. Despite ongoing debate,
extra-intracranial bypass remains an essential part of cerebrovascular surgery.
The key to success lies in the proper selection of patients and precise
microsurgical execution. Modern approaches and technologies help reduce the risk
of complications and enhance the effectiveness of this intervention, offering
hope to patients with otherwise limited treatment options.

A brief history of carotid artery disease and carotid endarterectomy.
Přibáň V, Moláček J.
INTRODUCTION: The authors discuss the history of carotid disease and injuries
and focus on historical milestones of carotid endarterectomy worldwide and in
Bohemia.
RESULTS: The first part discusses the carotid artery and ischemic stroke,
beginning with Hippocrates' description of apoplexy. It then highlights Willis's
discovery of the collateral circulation, followed by the 19th-century
thromboembolic theory of ischemic stroke caused by carotid artery occlusion,
which is associated with the work of Wirchow and Chiari. Then, in the 1950s, C.
M. Fisher visionarily pointed out the possible surgical management of carotid
stenosis in the prevention of stroke. In the second part, carotid ligature,
treatments for arterial injuries are mentioned, starting with A. Paré in 1552,
to ligature of the extracranial carotid artery for intracranial aneurysm by V.
Horsley in 1885. The third part describes the history of reconstructive carotid
surgery, especially carotid endarterectomy worldwide, with the priorities of
Carrea, Eastcott and DeBakey in the early 1950s. The priority in Bohemia belongs
to Jaroslav Lhotka, who published his results in 1962.
CONCLUSION: The authors summarize the history of carotid disease, especially
carotid endarterectomy, worldwide and in Bohemia.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review examines the enzymatic regulation of coagulation
and fibrinolysis, focusing on key players such as thrombin, plasmin, and
ADAMTS13. We highlight how dysregulation of these enzymes contributes to
thrombotic and hemorrhagic disorders and review emerging diagnostic biomarkers
and therapeutic strategies.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies demonstrate the prognostic utility of biomarkers
such as thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) and plasmin-α2-antiplasmin (PAP) complexes
across critical illnesses including trauma, sepsis, and stroke. Advances in
plasmin and thrombin generation assays, enzyme-specific assays, and
enzyme-modulating therapies (e.g., factor XI inhibitors and recombinant
ADAMTS13) are reshaping approaches to hemostatic balance.
SUMMARY: Understanding hemostatic enzymatic regulation offers new avenues for
risk stratification, diagnosis, and treatment of coagulation disorders. Although
significant progress has been made, challenges remain in translating laboratory
findings to clinical practice, necessitating further large-scale validation.
Precision-guided enzymatic therapies hold promise for improving outcomes in
acute care settings.

BACKGROUND: Lumbar drainage (LD) and external ventricular drainage (EVD) are
used in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) for
cerebrospinal fluid diversion and blood clearance. While both have potential
benefits, the relative efficacy and safety of LD versus EVD remain unclear,
particularly given their use in differing clinical contexts. This study aims to
provide a crude comparison of LD and EVD in the context of aSAH using the most
updated and comprehensive meta-analysis.
METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic review and
pair-wise meta-analyses of 28 studies (4390 patients). Cohorts were analyzed
across three contrasts-LD vs non-LD, EVD vs non-EVD, and LD vs EVD-using
random-effects models. Outcomes included rebleeding, clinical vasospasm, delayed
ischemic neurological deficit (DIND)/ischemic stroke, functional status (mRS 0-2
early and late; GOS ≤ 2), mortality, infection, and shunt dependency.
RESULTS: Compared with non-LD, LD lowered the odds of vasospasm (OR 0.51, 95 %
CI 0.33 to 0.78), DIND/ischemic stroke (OR 0.55, 0.37 to 0.83), severe
disability/vegetative state (GOS ≤ 2) (OR 0.28, 0.17 to 0.46), and mortality (OR
0.59, 0.41 to 0.85) without affecting rebleeding rates. Versus non-EVD, EVD
reduced ischemic complications (OR 0.39, 0.16 to 0.96) but increased infection
risk (OR 11.58, 1.45 to 92.71); vasospasm and rebleeding were similar. Direct
comparison showed LD superior to EVD for early functional independence (OR 1.92,
1.06 to 3.50) and mortality (OR 0.49, 0.30 to 0.81), while rebleeding,
vasospasm, infections, and shunt dependency were similar.
CONCLUSION: LD was associated with lower rates of vasospasm, ischemic
complications, severe disability, and mortality compared to non-LD, without
increasing rebleeding risk. EVD reduced ischemic complications but was linked to
higher infection rates. When directly compared, LD was favored for early
functional recovery and survival. These findings should be interpreted in light
of differing clinical indications and baseline severity. Further studies are
needed.

BackgroundSurvivors of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) often have
cognitive impairment, which may be caused by long-term inflammation. We aimed to
determine whether long-term neuroinflammation or microstructural brain damage is
associated with cognitive impairment after aSAH.MethodsIn this prospective
cohort study, we included patients >3 years after aSAH between 2020 and 2022.
Patients underwent neuropsychological evaluation, translocator protein 18 kDA
(TSPO) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using [18F]DPA-714 to
determine neuroinflammation, and brain diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) to
determine microstructural damage. We compared TSPO PET binding potential, mean
kurtosis (MK), kurtosis anisotropy (KA), axial kurtosis (AK) and radial kurtosis
(RA) between groups and determined which metric was correlated with individual
cognitive tests.ResultsWe included 27 patients with aSAH; 14 with and 13 without
cognitive impairment. Whole brain TSPO binding potential was similar between
groups (Mean BPND -0.046 [95% CI -0.105; 0.013] vs -0.047 [95% CI -0.108;
0.014], p = 0.98) and there were no regional differences. Those with cognitive
impairment had a lower whole brain MK (mean MK 0.70 [95% CI 0.69-0.72] vs 0.73
[95% CI 0.72-0.74], p = 0.03) and whole brain AK (mean AK 0.81 [95% CI
0.78-0.83] vs 0.86 [0.84-0.87], p = 0.04). Left thalamic MK and AK were
correlated with tests of verbal memory (r = 0.60-0.67, p < 0.01), while other
correlation tests were non-significant.ConclusionsOur results do not support the
hypothesis that long-term cognitive impairment after aSAH is caused by long-term
neuroinflammation. Instead, microstructural damage may play a role.

BACKGROUND: The outcome of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) in
Parkinson's disease carriers of GBA1 mutations (GBA-PD) remains uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of LCIG in a large PD cohort,
focusing on GBA1 variants.
METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective, longitudinal "real-world" study
included consecutive patients with advanced PD treated with LCIG at 31 Italian
centers; data were collected at baseline, 1-, 5-year, and last-available
follow-up.
RESULTS: Data from 512 PD patients (59% male, mean age and disease duration at
LCIG initiation 67.0 ± 8.0 and 12.9 ± 5.0 years, respectively) were analyzed.
GBA1 genotyping was available for 306 patients (60%), of whom 40 (13%) had GBA1
mutations or risk variants. Mean follow-up on LCIG was 3.9 ± 2.9 years; 5-year
follow-up data were available for 159 subjects. At baseline, GBA-PD had a
younger age, shorter PD duration, worse cognition, and more hallucinations than
noncarriers. At 1- and 5-year follow-up, LCIG improved motor and non-motor
symptoms, OFF-time, and dyskinesias in the entire population. In GBA-PD,
MDS-UPDRS parts I, II, and III scores did not change, while part IV score
improved significantly less than in noncarriers; cognition and orthostatic
hypotension symptoms worsened more rapidly. Multivariate analysis of predictors
for adverse events and LCIG discontinuation found no significant contribution
from GBA1 mutation status.
CONCLUSIONS: GBA1 status does not increase the risk of adverse events or LCIG
discontinuation. LCIG is a safe option for advanced GBA-PD, even in patients
with cognitive impairment at baseline. However, GBA-PD experiences lower
efficacy on motor disability and complications and faster cognitive decline than
noncarriers.

BackgroundThe relationship between the functional recovery of patients in the
subacute phase of stroke and descending neural drives from the non-injured
hemisphere to the paretic lower limb muscles during movement remains unclear. We
investigated this relationship in patients with severe
paralysis.MethodsTwenty-nine patients with stroke were recruited and categorized
into three groups based on paralysis severity. Within 1 month of admission, each
patient received 10 min of anodal tDCS applied to the cortical motor areas of
the injured or non-injured hemispheres. Each stimulation condition was performed
in a random order, one day at a time, with a 7-day washout period. Before and
after each stimulation, patients performed multiple voluntary knee extensions on
the paretic side 20% of their maximal strength, sustained for 6 s. Coherence
analysis of EMG signals from proximal and distal segments of the vastus medialis
muscle was conducted to quantify common neural drive from each cortical
motor-related area based on coherence variations before and post stimulation in
each condition. We investigated the relationship between the excitability of the
descending neural pathway from the non-injured hemisphere in the initial phase
and motor function recovery at 3 months.ResultsNo significant differences
emerged across groups in the change in coherence values when the non-injured
hemisphere stimulated. However, within the severe group, an increase in β-band
coherence following non-injured hemisphere stimulation correlated with greater
recovery of paretic-side muscle strength and trunk function at 3
months.ConclusionOur findings deepen understanding of paralysis pathophysiology
based on severity level and may support the development of targeted
neuromodulation strategies to enhance motor recovery.
