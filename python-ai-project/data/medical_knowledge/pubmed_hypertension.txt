Studies have shown sex differences in the outcomes of chronic thromboembolic 
pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and in patients who have undergone pulmonary 
endarterectomy. Limited data exist regarding outcomes of balloon pulmonary 
angioplasty (BPA) for female versus male subjects. In this analysis cohort, a 
total of 767 sessions of BPA were performed on 144 patients of which 83 (58%) 
were female. There were no differences in age, body mass index and comorbidities 
between males and females. However, females had worse baseline functional class, 
higher median N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and a shorter 6-min walk 
test. At baseline, males were more likely to be on pulmonary hypertension (PH) 
medical treatment before BPA (92% vs 76%, p = 0.008), and females had 
significantly higher pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) (5.5 ± 3.0 wu vs 
3.9 ± 1.9 wu, p < 0.001). After BPA, the improvements in mean pulmonary artery 
pressure and PVR from baseline were comparable in both groups. The requirement 
for PH medical therapy significantly reduced after BPA for males (92% vs. 80%, 
p = 0.008) but not for females. Functional class improved in both groups after 
BPA. There were no significant differences in complication rates per BPA session 
between male and female patients (9% and 12%, p = 0.104). Female CTEPH patients 
had a worse baseline clinical profile including higher PVR. Female patients were 
also more likely to remain on PH medical therapy after BPA. There were no 
significant differences observed in hemodynamic response to BPA and in 
complication rates between male and female patients.

BACKGROUND: Whether specific antihypertensive treatments increase cancer risk in 
patients with hypertension is still controversial. We aimed to estimate the 
associations of different antihypertensive treatments with cancer risk in 
real-world settings.
METHODS: A longitudinal cohort study was designed in a population of 1.2 million 
individuals from the CHinese Electronic health Records Research in Yinzhou 
(CHERRY). Propensity score matching (PSM) and the Cox regression model were used 
to estimate the associations. Several sensitivity analyses were then performed 
to reduce potential residual confounding.
RESULTS: From 2009 to 2019, a total of 270,320 patients with newly diagnosed 
hypertension were included in this study. With a median follow-up time of 
7.7 years, 14,264 cases of cancer occurred. There were no significant 
associations of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin 
receptor blockers (ARBs), β-blockers, or thiazide diuretics (TDs) with cancer 
risk (p > 0.05). Compared with other antihypertensive treatments, the use of 
calcium channel blockers (CCBs) was significantly associated with a marginally 
mild increase in the risk of all cancers (hazard ratio, HR = 1.05; 95% CI: 1.01, 
1.09; p = 0.017). However, this association was no longer observed in 
sensitivity analyses excluding patients with less than 1, 2, or 3 years of 
follow-up. Nevertheless, the association between CCBs and the risk of endocrine 
cancer, especially thyroid cancer, still exists.
CONCLUSION: Despite previous controversy, in this study, we found no clinically 
meaningful cancer risk associated with antihypertensive medications. However, 
the association of CCBs with specific cancer still requires further research. 
These findings should be interpreted with caution due to the potential residual 
confounding.

Current Practice of Children With Primary Hypertension: A Survey of 
Pediatricians in Thailand.

(1)Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.

BACKGROUND: Being able to detect, assess, and manage children with primary 
hypertension is one of the requirements of the Thai pediatric residency training 
curriculum. The present study aimed to survey the practice of pediatric primary 
hypertension care by Thai pediatricians.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants' demographic information, educational 
background, and practice, including diagnosis, investigation, and treatment in 
children with primary hypertension at an outpatient setting, were all included 
in the surveys and were distributed to pediatric residents, general 
pediatricians, and pediatric subspecialists in Thailand using the online survey. 
The results were defined as appropriate answers if they were aligned with the 
guidelines recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
RESULTS: 342 (79 males) with a mean age of 37.6 years and a mean duration since 
residency training of 10.4 years were included. The proportion of participants 
who answered appropriately was 188 (55%), 190 (55.6%), and 169 (49.4%) in the 
diagnosis, investigation, and treatment parts, respectively. However, only 43 
(12.6%) participants could answer appropriately for all 3 parts. Compared to the 
inappropriate group, experience in diagnosis was higher in the appropriate group 
(44.2% vs 28.4%, P-value = 0.036), but the duration since residency 
training < 5 years and being a nephrologist were not different between the 2 
groups (41.9% vs 43.5%, P = .849 and 7 vs 6%, P = .807, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Experience in diagnosis, rather than the duration after the 
residency training or being a nephrologist, had a favorable impact on the 
appropriate practices of children with primary hypertension among Thai 
pediatricians.

Loneliness is a complex and usually unpleasant emotional response to isolation, 
which has been considered the latest global health epidemic exacerbated by the 
coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, affecting nearly two-thirds of older adults. 
Some profound health implications carried by loneliness include depression, 
cognitive impairment, hypertension and frailty. Across the world, there is no 
consensus definition of loneliness, and its measure is based on the 
phenomenological perspective of the individual. The 20-item University of 
California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale version 3 (UCLA-20) is the most common 
measure. This scale demonstrates acceptable psychometric properties but is too 
long and complex for a phone interview. This paper addresses the increasing need 
to shorten this scale by adopting classical item response theory and network 
psychometrics to advance scale development. Through an item reduction analysis, 
we trimmed the original scale into an effective short form, which is as valid as 
the original one. With respondents' time at a premium in most research nowadays, 
this short-form scale is an efficient and practical alternative to the original 
UCLA-20.

BACKGROUND: Hematoma expansion (HE) in hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage 
(HICH) is significantly associated with patient mortality. Early identification 
of HE would be planning for appropriate and aggressive management for improving 
outcome and containing HE. Existing HE prediction models show variable accuracy 
across settings. To address this limitation, we developed and validate a new 
predictive model to enhance the accuracy of HE in patients with HICH.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from two centers. 
The primary outcome was the occurrence of HE within 24 h of symptom onset, 
defined as an increase in hematoma volume ≥33% or ≥12.5 mL on follow-up imaging. 
Logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of HE, and the 
HE-VSD-A2TP score system was developed and validated.
RESULTS: Five hundred and sixty seven patients in the derivation cohort and 378 
patients in the validation cohort. The HE-VSD-A2TP score included age, 
uncontrolled blood pressure, hematoma volume, irregularity/lobulation shape, 
non-homogeneous density, presentation within 6 h from symptom onset to CT, and 
the use of anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy. The HE-VSD-A2TP score 
demonstrated superior discrimination in predicting HE compared to existing 
models like PREDICT, 9-point, and BRAIN scores, with an AUC of 0.871(95%CI 
0.839-0.904) in the derivation cohort and 0.858 (95%CI 0.819-0.897) in the 
validation cohort. The score also showed excellent calibration and outperformed 
other models in terms of sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, negative 
predictive value, and positive predictive value. With regard to clinical 
usefulness, the decision curve analysis (DCA) of HE-VSD-A2TP showed higher net 
benefit than PREDICT, 9-point, and BRAIN scores in the both cohorts.
CONCLUSION: The HE-VSD-A2TP score was validated to be an effective tool for 
identifying patients at risk of HE in patients with HICH. It was a valuable tool 
for guiding clinical management strategies and potentially improving patient 
outcomes.

Association between triglyceride glucose-waist-adjusted waist index and incident 
stroke in Chinese adults: a prospective cohort study.

Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.

OBJECTIVE: Current literature lacks evidence on the association between the 
triglyceride glucose-weight-adjusted waist index (TyG-WWI) and incident stroke. 
Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the relationship between TyG-WWI and 
stroke risk in a nationally representative cohort of middle-aged and elderly 
Chinese adults by: (1) Quantitatively assessing its prospective association with 
incident stroke, and (2) Investigating potential nonlinear relationships and 
inflection points.
METHODS: This national longitudinal study examined data from five waves of the 
CHARLS (2011-2020). TyG-WWI served as the key exposure variable, while stroke 
incidence, as determined by physician diagnosis, was the principal outcome of 
interest. Associations were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models 
alongside nonlinear analyses, with careful adjustment for a range of covariates. 
To further ensure the reliability of our findings, we performed a series of 
sensitivity and subgroup analyses.
RESULTS: In this study, we investigated the association between TyG-WWI and 
stroke risk. The results demonstrated a significant positive correlation between 
TyG-WWI quartiles and stroke risk, with HRs of 1.35 (95% CI 1.08-1.69, 
p = 0.0094), 1.38 (95% CI 1.09-1.73, p = 0.0069), and 1.42 (95% CI 1.09-1.85, 
p = 0.0086) for Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively, compared to Q1 in Model III (P for 
trend = 0.0158). A two-piecewise linear regression model revealed an inflection 
point of TyG-WWI at 43.32, with a significant association between TyG-WWI and 
stroke risk only above this point (HR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05, p = 0.0008). 
Stratified analysis indicated a more robust association in non-hypertensive 
individuals (HR = 1.94, 95% CI 1.29-2.91, p = 0.0014 in Q4) and a significant 
interaction for hypertension status (P for interaction = 0.0493).
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study reveals a significant association between 
TyG-WWI and stroke risk in the middle-aged and elderly population in China, with 
stroke risk increasing progressively across higher TyG-WWI quartiles. Notably, 
this association was significantly more pronounced in non-hypertensive 
individuals. Furthermore, an inflection point indicates a stronger association 
beyond this threshold.

Ablation of Prdm16 and beige fat causes vascular remodeling and elevated blood 
pressure.

While excess adiposity is a major risk factor for hypertension and 
cardiovascular disease, brown fat is associated with protection from these 
pathologies. Whether brown fat has a causal role in this process and the 
underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here we investigate the role of 
murine beige fat, as a model of inducible brown fat in humans, in 
adipocyte-vascular crosstalk. Using mice with an adipocyte-specific deletion of 
PRDM16, resulting in a loss of beige adipocyte identity, we discover a dramatic 
remodeling of perivascular adipose tissue, increased vascular reactivity and 
elevated blood pressure. We further show that the circulating enzyme Qsox1 is 
de-repressed in Prdm16 -deficient adipocytes, and deletion of Qsox1 in PRDM16cKO 
mice rescues vascular fibrosis and reactivity. These results demonstrate a key 
new role for beige adipocytes in blood pressure regulation and identify Qsox1 as 
an important mediator of adipocyte-vascular crosstalk.

Flow-sensitive HEG1 controls eNOS activity to prevent endothelial dysfunction, 
hypertension, and atherosclerosis.

Clark MD, Kim Y, Romero CA, Kang DW, Baek KI, Song EJ, Kellum CE, Bowman-Kirigin 
JA, Park C, Kapoor V, Pollock JS, Jo H.

Hypertension (HTN), the chronic elevation of blood pressure, accounts for more 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease deaths than any other modifiable risk 
factor. 1 In the arteries, stable blood flow (s-flow) drives healthy, 
atheroprotective endothelial cell (EC) functions including nitric oxide (NO) 
production, barrier function, and anti-inflammatory programs via the action of 
flow-sensitive proteins. We showed that s-flow stimulates Heart-of-Glass 1 
(HEG1) protein expression, localization to cell-cell junctions, and secretion 
from ECs. 2 We found that conditional, endothelial cell-specific knockout of ( 
Heg1 ECKO ) exacerbates atherosclerosis 2 , however the mechanism was unknown. 
Here, we report a new role of HEG1 in controlling EC dysfunction, hypertension 
and atherosclerosis. We discover a novel mechanism: HEG1 regulates NO 
bioavailability via a flow-dependent HEG1-eNOS interaction (endothelial nitric 
oxide synthase, NOS3). Heg1 ECKO develops spontaneous hypertension and severe 
atherosclerosis, both of which are effectively treated by Angiotensin-Converting 
Enzyme inhibition (ACEi). UK BioBank and Swedish cohort studies reveal that 
plasma HEG1 levels are associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease 
risk. 3,4 Our findings suggest HEG1 may serve as a biomarker to advance 
personalized therapies for EC dysfunction, hypertension, and atherosclerosis.

Paracrine Action of Bone Morphogenetic Protein 3 in Pulmonary Arterial 
Hypertension.

Halouani A, Mensiah E, Athumani Z, Katz MG, Jankowski K, Mansoori M, Rosen V, 
Ishikawa K, Hadri L, Sassi Y.

BACKGROUND: Despite recent advancements in the management of pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (PAH), the disease remains devastating, with limited survival. 
Although the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway is known to play 
an important role in PAH, our current understanding of this pathway remains 
limited.
METHODS: We assessed BMP3 levels in the lungs of mice, rats, and pigs with 
pulmonary hypertension, and in pulmonary vascular cells from human patients with 
PAH. We performed in vitro studies on human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells 
(hPASMCs) and human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (hPAECs) derived from 
healthy donors and from patients with PAH. We generated mice with global or 
SMC-specific deletion of BMP3. Recombinant BMP3 protein and adeno-associated 
viruses (AAV) were used to overexpress BMP3 in two different models of PAH in 
rodents. Magnetic resonance imaging, cardiac hemodynamics, morphometric, and 
histological measurements were performed to evaluate the effects of BMP3 on 
cardiac function and pulmonary vascular remodeling.
RESULTS: BMP3 is predominantly expressed in PASMCs and is downregulated in PAH. 
In vitro, conditioned medium from siRNA-BMP3-transfected hPASMCs increased 
hPAECs migration and proliferation, while PASMC-derived BMP3 inhibited 
PAH-diseased PAEC dysfunction. In both global and SMC-specific BMP3-deficient 
mice, exposure to a model of PAH exacerbated cardiac and pulmonary vascular 
remodeling in middle-aged mice. An intraperitoneally injected recombinant BMP3 
prevented and reversed PAH in mice. A lung-targeted overexpression of BMP3, via 
AAV1-BMP3, reversed pulmonary vascular remodeling and inhibited cardiac 
dysfunction in mice and rats. Mechanistically, BMP3 activated the BMP/Smad1,5,8 
pathway, inhibited the TGF-β/Smad2,3 pathway, and decreased the expression of 
cell cycle genes in hPAECs and in the lungs of BMP3-treated animals with PAH.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence that BMP3 overexpression attenuates 
pulmonary vascular remodeling and inhibits cardiac dysfunction by restoring the 
balance between the TGF-β and BMP pathways through a cell-cell communication 
mechanism, offering a novel therapeutic pathway for PAH.
CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE: What is New?: BMP3 is downregulated in the lungs of mice, 
rats, and pigs with pulmonary hypertension and in pulmonary artery smooth muscle 
cells of patients with PAH.BMP3 acts as a paracrine factor between pulmonary 
vascular cells.Overexpression of BMP3 decreases pulmonary vascular remodeling 
and reverses cardiac dysfunction in PAH-diseased rodents.BMP3 acts by restoring 
the balance between the TGF-β/Smad2,3 pathway and the BMP/Smad1,5,8 pathwayWhat 
Are the Clinical Implications?: BMP3 represents a promising disease-modifying 
agent with potential for clinical translation in the treatment of 
PAH.Overexpressing BMP3 with Adeno-Associated Viruses has therapeutic potential 
to treat PAH.

The 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 maleate reprograms metabolism to 
promote RGC differentiation and regeneration in retino-visual centers.

Dutta S, Surma ML, Chen J, Anbarasu K, Meng J, Wang N, Das A.

Metabolic collapse of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) onsets glaucoma, yet no 
approved drug directly protects these neurons. Through a live-cell mitochondrial 
screen in human stem-cell-derived hRGCs we uncovered WAY-100635 (WAY), a 
clinically tested 5-HT1A antagonist, as a systemic neuroprotectant. WAY triggers 
a reversible cyclic-AMP surge that activates PGC-1α-driven reversible 
mitochondrial biogenesis and suppresses apoptosis. In glaucoma associated OPTN 
E50K hRGCs, WAY restores mitochondrial fitness, dampens excitotoxicity, and 
reprograms metabolism toward aerobic glycolysis, while in progenitors WAY boosts 
mitochondrial cristae maturation, oxidative phosphorylation, and cell-cycle exit 
to accelerate RGC specification. Daily intraperitoneal dosing preserves RGC 
bodies, neural activity, promotes axon regeneration into the optic nerve and 
vision centers after optic-nerve crush, as well as shows RGC protection and 
maintenance of visual acuity in chronic ocular hypertension glaucoma. As the 
non-invasive neuroprotective therapy with a human safety profile, WAY addresses 
a critical gap in glaucoma care and potentially for other mitochondrial optic 
neuropathies.

BACKGROUND: Hypertension is associated with the improvement of cardiovascular 
disease and all-cause mortality. A healthy diet based on consuming natural foods 
can prevent and control hypertension.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of tomato and 
cucumber juice in reducing the blood pressure of hypertensive patients.
METHODS: The study used a quasi-experiment pretest-posttest control group 
design. The target population are people with hypertension Stage 1, people 
living in urban area - Cibiru Health Centre Work Area. Purposive sampling was 
used and the sample size was calculated using the average comparison formula 
with effect size=0.9, α=0.05, β =0.2. Forty-five subjects involved in the study 
were divided into three groups (15 subjects were given tomato juice, 15 subjects 
were given cucumber juice, and 15 subjects were given treatment with mineral 
water (control group)., This research used 100 grams of ripe red tomatoes, 100 
grams of fresh cucumber, and 200 ml of water. The data collected were patient 
characteristics and blood pressure. The ANOVA analysis test and the Bonferroni 
Post Hoc test were used to analyze the data.
RESULTS: The results of the study showed a difference in blood pressure 
reduction in each group. The decrease in systolic blood pressure in the tomato 
juice group was 7.3±3.1, the cucumber juice group was 4.2±3.3, and the control 
group was -0.0±2.5 (p=0.0001). The decrease in diastolic blood pressure in the 
group given tomato juice was 9.2±3.1, the group given cucumber juice was 
7.6±3.4, and the control group was 0.4±2.1 (p=0.0001).
CONCLUSION: There is a difference in blood pressure reduction between the group 
given tomato juice and the control group, and there is a difference in blood 
pressure between the group given cucumber juice and the control group.

INTRODUCTION: Obstetrical disorders critically impact maternal and fetal health. 
Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) regulates pregnancy maintenance and 
maternal-infant outcomes through hormonal, metabolic, and inflammatory pathways, 
yet causal relationships with obstetrical disorders remain unclear. This 
Mendelian randomization (MR) study examined SHBG's causal effects on 12 
obstetrical conditions.
METHODS: Using cis-protein quantitative trait loci (cis-pQTLs) of SHBG as 
instrumental variables, we conducted MR analyses in FinnGen and UK Biobank 
(UKBB), followed by meta-analyses. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was primary 
method, with sensitivity analyses ensuring robustness.
RESULTS: IVW-MR demonstrated reduced risks with elevated SHBG: gestational 
diabetes (OR[95%]=0.835[0.785-0.889], P FDR=2.03×10-7), hyperemesis gravidarum 
(OR[95%]=0.823[0.728-0.931], P FDR=5.94×10-3), gestational hypertension 
(OR[95%]=0.917[0.852-0.987], P FDR=0.041), and early-pregnancy hemorrhage 
(OR[95%]=0.853[0.794-0.916], P FDR=6.90×10-5). Meta-analysis confirmed SHBG's 
causal role in gestational diabetes (P_combined<0.05). COLOC revealed shared 
loci between SHBG and five disorders: gestational diabetes, hyperemesis, early 
hemorrhage, preterm delivery, and postpartum hemorrhage.
CONCLUSION: SHBG causally lowers risks of gestational diabetes, hypertension, 
hyperemesis, miscarriage, and preterm delivery, highlighting its clinical 
relevance in obstetrical pathophysiology.

Hospitals NHS Trust, St Helens, GBR.

Retinal pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) result from a disruption at the 
junction between the basement membrane of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) 
and the innermost part of Bruch's membrane. Serous retinal PEDs, whether 
singular or multiple, are frequently seen across a broad spectrum of ophthalmic 
disorders. Additionally, PEDs have been associated with various systemic 
conditions, including renal, hypertensive, endocrine, and hematologic 
disorders. Idiopathic PEDs, which occur without an associated underlying 
condition, are exceedingly rare, with only a few cases reported in the 
literature. Herein, we report a case of an asymptomatic and otherwise healthy 
individual with multiple idiopathic retinal PEDs, highlighting the importance of 
a comprehensive clinical examination and multimodal ophthalmic imaging.

We report a case of monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS) in a 
65-year-old female patient who presented to the emergency department with 
uncontrolled hypertension, generalized edema, abdominal distension, and frothy 
urine. Apart from recently diagnosed hypertension, she had no significant 
comorbidities. Examination revealed periorbital swelling, bibasal crackles, 
moderate ascites, and bilateral lower limb pitting edema. Laboratory findings 
showed proteinuria, low complement levels, elevated IgM, decreased IgG, and the 
presence of cryoglobulins. Imaging and PET-CT ruled out malignancy. Kidney 
biopsy revealed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with cryoglobulin 
deposition and vasculitis. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed plasma cell dyscrasia 
with kappa light chain restriction. Despite suspicion of Waldenström 
macroglobulinemia or IgM myeloma, cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ 
hybridization were negative. The patient was treated with rituximab and 
corticosteroids, with complete resolution of ascites, edema, and proteinuria. 
This case highlights an uncommon presentation of IgM kappa-related MGRS with 
type I cryoglobulinemia.

Ectopic catecholamine production by non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is 
exceptionally rare and, to our knowledge, has not been previously reported in 
the literature. We present the case of a 68-year-old woman with advanced lung 
adenocarcinoma who presented in hypertensive crisis due to markedly elevated 
normetanephrine levels. Initial suspicion was for pheochromocytoma, but normal 
chromogranin A levels suggested a paraneoplastic phenomenon. Despite 
alpha-adrenergic blockade, the patient's metastatic disease and refractory 
hypertension contributed to poor treatment tolerance, ultimately necessitating 
transition to hospice care. This case underscores the importance of considering 
atypical endocrine manifestations of NSCLC and highlights the challenges of 
managing advanced cancer complicated by paraneoplastic syndromes.

INTRODUCTION: Hypertension is a persistent global health issue, with 
psychological factors like stress, anxiety, and depression increasingly studied 
as potential contributors. However, their independent associations with 
hypertension remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE:  To examine the relationship between stress (using self-reported 
irritability as a proxy), anxiety, and depression with both the prevalence and 
severity of hypertension in a nationally representative adult population.
METHODS:  A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using publicly available data 
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally 
representative survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC). The study included 18,891 adults aged 18 and older. 
Hypertension was defined by self-reported medical diagnosis. Psychological 
variables included depression and anxiety scores, with stress proxied by 
reported irritability. Covariates included age, gender, race/ethnicity, physical 
activity, and BMI. Due to missing data, multiple imputation by chained equations 
(MICE) was applied. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess 
associations.
RESULTS: After adjustment, stress was significantly linked to higher odds of 
hypertension (β = 0.30, p < 0.03), while anxiety and depression were not. Older 
age, higher body mass index (BMI), and physical inactivity were also significant 
risk factors. Non-Hispanic Black and White participants had greater odds of 
hypertension compared to Mexican Americans.
CONCLUSION: Stress was independently associated with hypertension, emphasizing 
the relevance of emotional strain in cardiovascular risk. Anxiety and depression 
showed no significant association. Findings support the inclusion of stress 
assessment in hypertension screening, though results are limited by the study's 
cross-sectional design and reliance on imputed data.

BACKGROUND: Inadequate pharmacologic stress may limit the diagnostic and 
prognostic accuracy of myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). The splenic ratio 
(SR), a measure of stress adequacy, has emerged as a potential imaging 
biomarker.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prognostic value of artificial intelligence 
(AI)-derived SR in a large multicenter 82 Rb-PET cohort undergoing regadenoson 
stress testing.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 10,913 patients from three sites in the 
REFINE PET registry with clinically indicated MPI and linked clinical outcomes. 
SR was calculated using fully automated algorithms as the ratio of splenic 
uptake at stress versus rest. Patients were stratified by SR into high (≥90th 
percentile) and low (<90th percentile) groups. The primary outcome was major 
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Survival analysis was conducted using 
Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for clinical and 
imaging covariates, including myocardial flow reserve (MFR ≥2 vs. <2).
RESULTS: The cohort had a median age of 68 years, with 57% male patients. Common 
risk factors included hypertension (84%), dyslipidemia (76%), diabetes (33%), 
and prior coronary artery disease (31%). Median follow-up was 4.6 years. 
Patients with high SR (n=1,091) had an increased risk of MACE (HR 1.18, 95% CI 
1.06-1.31, p=0.002). Among patients with preserved MFR (≥2; n=7,310), high SR 
remained independently associated with MACE (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.24-1.67, 
p<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated AI-derived SR was independently associated with adverse 
cardiovascular outcomes, including among patients with preserved MFR. These 
findings support SR as a novel, automated imaging biomarker for risk 
stratification in 82 Rb PET MPI.
CONDENSED ABSTRACT: AI-derived splenic ratio (SR), a marker of pharmacologic 
stress adequacy, was independently associated with increased cardiovascular risk 
in a large 82 Rb PET cohort, even among patients with preserved myocardial flow 
reserve (MFR). High SR identified individuals with elevated MACE risk despite 
normal perfusion and flow findings, suggesting unrecognized physiologic 
vulnerability. Incorporating automated SR into PET MPI interpretation may 
enhance risk stratification and identify patients who could benefit from 
intensified preventive care, particularly when traditional imaging markers 
appear reassuring. These findings support SR as a clinically meaningful, easily 
integrated biomarker in stress PET imaging.

A Case of Stanford Type A Aortic Dissection Presenting as Syncope and Neurologic 
Deficits Without Pain: Diagnostic Pitfalls and a Therapeutic Dilemma.

Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a true medical emergency that classically 
presents with sudden severe tearing chest pain that may radiate to the back or 
with tearing abdominal pain. When it presents atypically without pain, 
diagnostic delays or misdiagnosis are common, often with devastating 
consequences. We report the case of a 59-year-old male with uncontrolled 
hypertension who first presented to an outside emergency department (ED) with 
multiple collapses and was discharged after assessment. He presented 48 hours 
later to our ED following collapse and loss of consciousness. The patient was in 
shock upon arrival. Transient right upper limb weakness and slurring of speech 
were noted on initial assessment. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with cardiogenic 
shock was suspected on the basis of electrocardiographic (ECG) changes and 
raised troponin, and ACS treatment was administered. However, bedside 
echocardiogram performed to assess left ventricular function as part of the ACS 
work-up suggested Stanford type A AAD, which was confirmed by computed tomogram 
(CT) of the aorta. Emergency surgical repair of the aorta was performed after 
transfer to a tertiary hospital, with good postoperative recovery. This case 
highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for aortic 
dissection in patients presenting with syncope and neurological deficits even in 
the absence of classical symptoms. Simulation training specifically tailored to 
scenarios of atypical presentations of AAD may be of benefit to emergency 
clinicians and help reduce the unacceptably high rate of misdiagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Heatwaves and hurricanes pose risks to public health, especially for 
vulnerable populations.
METHODS: We assessed the impact of extreme weather events on health outcomes in 
socially vulnerable groups. We analyzed hospital mortality, acute stroke, 
myocardial infarction, and nonelective intensive care unit (ICU) admissions for 
24,814 patients admitted to two hospitals in Jacksonville (2015-2017). We fitted 
modified Poisson regression models to assess differences relative to the 
heatwave and Hurricane Irma, presenting impacts with relative risks (RR) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CI).
RESULTS: There was no significant change in the rate of acute stroke or 
myocardial infarction during both the heatwave and Hurricane Irma. The rate of 
nonelective ICU admission showed no significant change during the heatwave and 
immediate posthurricane period (0-14 days after the hurricane) but increased 
during the extended posthurricane period (15-74 days after the hurricane) with 
an RR of 6.19 (95% CI = 1.25, 30.54) compared with the control period. Extreme 
climate events amplified disparities among vulnerable patient populations. 
During heatwave and extended posthurricane periods, the rate of acute stroke or 
myocardial infarction increased for elderly patients relative to younger 
patients with RRs of 1.43 (95% CI = 1.05, 1.94) and 1.53 (95% CI = 1.14, 2.07), 
and uninsured or Medicaid-insured patients relative to those with Medicare or 
private insurance with RRs of 1.71 (95% CI = 1.26, 2.33) and 1.88 (95% CI = 
1.38, 2.59). Social vulnerability and air quality further impacted health 
outcomes during the extended posthurricane period, with a 0.1-unit increase in 
the Social Vulnerability Index score associated with a 65% decrease in risk of 
acute stroke or myocardial infarction with RR of 0.35 (95% CI = 0.16, 0.75) and 
a 69% decrease in risk of nonelective ICU admissions with RR of 0.31 (95% CI = 
0.15-0.65), and a 1-unit increase in Air Quality Index value indicated a 2% 
increase in risk of acute stroke or myocardial infarction with RR of 1.02 (95% 
CI = 1.01, 1.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest extreme climate events exacerbate negative 
health outcomes in socioeconomically vulnerable populations, underscoring the 
need for targeted public health interventions, improved healthcare access, and 
greater climate resilience in vulnerable communities.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is rare in children but exhibits a more 
dynamic course than in adults, often leading to multiorgan complications if 
diagnosis is delayed. This article aims to highlight diagnostic challenges of 
parathyroid adenomas in children and discuss associated complications from 
delayed diagnosis. Three boys, aged 15.5, 10, and 16 years, were retrospectively 
analyzed for hypercalcemia. The diagnosis was based on biochemical and hormonal 
tests, as well as imaging studies (ultrasound, scintigraphy, and densitometry). 
The mean diagnosis delay was 20 months (9-35). All boys experienced appetite 
loss and bone symptoms. Patient 1 was initially misdiagnosed with slipped 
capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) and underwent orthopedic surgery without 
recognition of severe hypercalcemia. Patient 2 was misdiagnosed with vasopressin 
deficiency following a tibia fracture. Patient 3's symptoms were attributed to 
stress. All patients had parathyroid adenomas, but Patients 2 and 3 had an 
ectopic thymus location. Following adenoma excision, Patients 2 and 3 developed 
hypocalcemia, the lasting consequences of which included nephrocalcinosis and 
low bone mass; Patient 3 also developed hypertension and depression. 
Conclusions: (1) any child presenting symptoms such as loss of appetite, 
abdominal pain, weight loss, depression, or bone abnormalities must urgently 
have serum calcium levels assessed to exclude PHPT. (2) Delayed diagnosis of 
PHPT in children is dangerous, as it leads to irreversible organ damage, 
including severe bone loss, nephrocalcinosis, and hypertension. (3) 
Comprehensive hormonal and genetic evaluation prior to surgery is essential, 
along with prompt correction of hypocalcemia to minimize complications and 
improve treatment outcomes. (4) After parathyroid adenoma removal, intensive 
calcium and vitamin D supplementation is required to prevent hungry bone 
syndrome and support proper bone recovery. (5) Due to the significant risk of 
disease recurrence, children with PHPT require long-term endocrine follow-up and 
thorough genetic testing, enabling early detection of relapse and timely 
intervention.

A 63-year-old man with a history of hypertension, prediabetes, and sleep apnea 
presented with pedal edema, weight loss, and flushing. Laboratory work revealed 
elevated B-type natriuretic peptide and normocytic anemia. Echocardiography 
showed right ventricular enlargement, severe tricuspid valve regurgitation, and 
thickened tricuspid valve leaflets, raising suspicion for carcinoid heart 
disease. Further testing confirmed a neuroendocrine tumor with liver metastasis. 
Despite somatostatin therapy, the patient's symptoms were refractory to 
diuretics. Surgical intervention with tricuspid and pulmonary valve replacement 
was undertaken. Postoperatively, the patient demonstrated substantial 
improvement in functional tolerance and quality of life. This case highlights

Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) is a fast-acting non-endothelium-dependent 
vasodilator, which is commonly used to treat diseases such as hypertensive 
emergencies and acute heart failure. However, there are few experimental studies 
evaluating the effects and mechanism of SNP on acute pulmonary embolism. To 
explore the mechanism of action of SNP in acute pulmonary embolism combined with 
shock, we randomly divided rabbits into sham operation group (S group, n = 8), 
model group (M group, n = 8), and SNP group (SNP group, n = 8). The rabbit model 
of acute massive pulmonary embolism with circulatory shock was established by 
injecting autologous blood clots into the pulmonary artery. Pulmonary 
angiography showed that the mean pulmonary artery pressure increased 
significantly and the mean arterial pressure decreased significantly in the 
model group, which could be reversed by SNP treatment. In addition, the 
TLR4/NF-κB/HIF-1α pathway signaling pathway was activated in the embolic and 
non-embolic areas of the lung tissue in the M group, promoting the release of 
inflammatory factors such as IL-6 and TNF-α, downregulation of endogenous NO 
expression in the model group. After SNP treatment, the expression of 
TLR4/NF-κB/HIF-1α pathway signals in the embolic and non-embolic areas was 
downregulated, the release of inflammatory factors was reduced, the release of 
vascular NO was increased. Our study shows that SNP has a protective effect on 
acute pulmonary embolism combined with shock. Its protective effect may be 
related to inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB/HIF-1α signaling pathway and increasing NO 
release in the embolic and non-embolic areas, thereby dilating pulmonary blood 
vessels, reducing the release of inflammatory factors and partially reversing 
circulatory failure in this model.

Application of SGLT-2 inhibitors in non-diabetic CKD: mechanisms, efficacy, and 
safety.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a major global public health challenge, 
significantly impacting patients' quality of life and placing a heavy burden on 
healthcare systems. While diabetes and hypertension are the primary risk factors 
for CKD, non-diabetic CKD also constitutes a significant proportion, with its 
complex pathological mechanisms necessitating the development of novel 
therapeutic strategies. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, 
initially developed for diabetes management, have recently demonstrated 
remarkable renal and cardiovascular protective effects in patients with 
non-diabetic CKD. SGLT-2 inhibitors exert their effects through multiple 
mechanisms, including reactivating the tubulo-glomerular feedback, reducing 
glomerular pressure and filtration rate, decreasing proteinuria, inhibiting 
inflammation and fibrosis, and improving systemic metabolic parameters such as 
lowering blood pressure, uric acid levels, and body weight. These effects not 
only slow the progression of kidney function decline but also significantly 
reduce the risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and cardiovascular events. 
Landmark clinical trials such as DAPA-CKD, CREDENCE, and EMPA-KIDNEY provide 
strong scientific evidence supporting the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors in 
non-diabetic CKD, demonstrating their broad clinical benefits and excellent 
safety profile. Despite potential adverse effects such as urinary tract 
infections, hypotension, and diabetic ketoacidosis, appropriate patient 
selection and personalized treatment strategies can effectively manage these 
risks. The multi-system effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors not only expand their 
clinical indications but also offer new hope for the comprehensive management of 
non-diabetic CKD patients, with significant clinical implications and broad 
future application potential.

BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia is a life-threatening pregnancy disorder characterized 
by hypertension and multiorgan dysfunction, posing significant risks to both 
maternal and fetal health. Although low-dose aspirin is widely recommended for 
preventing preeclampsia, the underlying mechanisms of action are still poorly 
understood, which hinders the optimization of therapeutic strategies.
METHODS: We developed an in vitro hypoxia-induced preeclampsia model using human 
trophoblast organoids to replicate key pathological features. RNA sequencing 
identified dysregulated pathways and molecular targets. Functional assays 
assessed the effects of aspirin on trophoblast proliferation, mitochondrial 
activity, and hormonal regulation, focusing on the PI3K-AKT pathway and CYP 
(cytochrome P450) enzymes. We also analyzed the effects of aspirin in the 
N'-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester hydrochloride rat models.
RESULTS: The hypoxia-induced preeclampsia model successfully mimicked clinical 
hallmarks, including elevated sFLT-1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1)/PlGF 
(placental growth factor) ratios and oxidative damage. RNA sequencing revealed 
significant suppression of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and dysregulation of CYP 
enzymes. Aspirin treatment restored the sFLT-1/PlGF balance, reactivated the 
PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, and improved mitochondrial function, enhancing 
trophoblast proliferation. Furthermore, aspirin regulated CYP expression by 
increasing CYP19A1 and inhibiting CYP1A1, thereby improving placental hormonal 
homeostasis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study clarifies aspirin's multitarget mechanisms in 
alleviating preeclampsia, which include restoring the sFLT-1/PlGF balance, 
activating the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, optimizing mitochondrial 
function, and regulating CYP-mediated hormonal metabolism. These findings 
provide a mechanistic basis for aspirin's clinical effectiveness in preventing 
preeclampsia.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy on fetal 
myocardial remodeling and cardiac function applying two-dimensional speckle 
tracking techniques.
METHODS: This is a case-control study with a 1:1 ratio, including fetuses with 
normal development and those exposed to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. A 
total of 108 fetuses were included in the study, comprising 54 in the case group 
and 54 in the control group. A series of parameters, including ventricular size, 
spherical index, ejection fraction, myocardial strain, fractional change in 
ventricular area, and short axis shortening rate, were measured using Fetal HQ 
software with two-dimensional speckle tracking imaging. Statistical methods were 
employed to compare the case and control groups, with the aim of assessing the 
impact of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy on fetal myocardial remodeling and 
cardiac function.
RESULTS: (1) The end-diastolic longitudinal diameter and area of the right 
ventricle in the HDP group were statistically significantly smaller than those 
in the control group (p < 0.05). However, no statistically significant 
differences were observed in the longitudinal and transverse diameters and areas 
of the four-chambered heart, as well as the longitudinal diameter and area of 
the left ventricle, when comparing the two groups (p > 0.05). (2) In terms of 
fetal cardiac morphology, the right ventricular segments 2-7 SI in the HDP group 
were observed to be smaller than those in the control group, with a 
statistically significant difference (p < 0.05). Conversely, the differences 
between the two groups in right ventricular segment 1, right ventricular 
segments 8-24 SI, left ventricular segments 24 SI and four-chambered cardiac GSI 
were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). (3) In terms of fetal ventricular 
systolic function, the HDP group exhibited lower left ventricular ejection 
fraction and cardiac output, right ventricular GLS, left and right ventricular 
FAC, left ventricular FS in segments 10-24, and right ventricular FS in segments 
11-16 than the control group. These differences were statistically significant 
(p < 0.05). Furthermore, the left ventricular GLS, GCS, and right ventricular 
free wall St, left ventricular segments 1-9, and right ventricular segments 1-10 
and 4-chamber GSI were observed to be lower than those of the control group. The 
GLS, GCS, and free wall St of the right ventricle, as well as the GLS, GCS, and 
free wall St of the left ventricle (segments 1-9) and the right ventricle 
(segments 1-10 and 12-24) were also evaluated.
CONCLUSION: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) have been demonstrated to 
affect fetal myocardial remodeling and contractile function, with a more 
pronounced impact observed on the right ventricle compared to the left 
ventricle. Two-dimensional speckle tracking technology offers the potential to 
provide more detailed information for the quantitative assessment of fetal size, 
morphology and cardiac function.

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a distinct, chronic inflammatory skin disease 
characterised by intensely pruritic, fibrotic nodular lesions. Despite continued 
progress in the field, lack of clarity regarding the definition of PN as a 
disease, clinical presentation and therapeutic options results in delayed 
diagnosis and management. PN can arise following other diseases, but once 
established, it is an independent disease. Here, we summarise the current 
knowledge of epidemiology, clinical characteristics, disease burden and 
management approaches that may help healthcare providers recognise PN as a 
primary diagnosis independent of triggers or associated comorbidities. PN is 
more common among patients aged 50-60 years, and some evidence suggests it is 
more frequent among Black populations than White and Asian populations. A subset 
of PN patients have an atopic background and can present with comorbid atopic 
dermatitis; however, PN can also exist without atopic comorbidities. Other 
comorbidities typically include diabetes, obesity, thyroid disease, kidney 
disease, chronic liver disease, hypertension, HIV infection, skin infections, 
malignancies and mental health disorders. Multiple intensely pruritic lesions 
induce chronic scratching, which leads to inflammation, hyperkeratotic nodules 
and perpetuation of a vicious itch-scratch cycle. PN is associated with a high 
disease burden and negative effect on quality of life; patients often report 
intense and relentless itching, poor sleep, absence from work, anxiety and 
depression. Early diagnosis of PN and identification of comorbidities are 
important to facilitate better disease management. By increasing their awareness 
of PN epidemiology, disease burden, clinical presentation and management, 
physicians may begin to identify the disease as a distinct condition independent 
of its triggers or associated comorbidities and provide patients with 
appropriate care earlier in their treatment journeys.

PURPOSE: Caregivers of hemodialysis patients are at high risk of developing 
reduced quality of life (QoL) and increased caregiver burden.
AIM: This study aims to explore the level of caregiver burden and quality of 
life in caregivers of hemodialysis patients in central India.
METHODS: This cross-sectional mixed-method study was undertaken among caregivers 
of stable hemodialysis patients attending a tertiary care hospital in central 
India. The Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) and WHOQoL BREF questionnaire measured 
caregiver burden and QoL. The qualitative data was gathered through in-depth 
interviews using a semi-structured open-ended questionnaire that delved into 
their personal experiences with caregiving. The transcripts of these interviews 
were analysed using applied thematic analysis, allowing for the identification 
and exploration of recurring themes and patterns within the data.
RESULTS: A total of 105 caregivers took part in this study, with a mean age of 
40.04 ± 12.96 years. 56 (53.3%) caregivers were female. Most (48.6%, n = 51) 
were spouses/partners. Ten caregivers (9.5%) had to change their occupations due 
to caregiving responsibilities. 14 (23.33%) had comorbidities (diabetes, 
hypertension, asthma, and arthritis) themselves. The mean caregiver burden level 
(ZBI) was 18.55 ± 7.58. Most (59.0%) experienced mild to moderate burden, while 
28.6% reported a high burden. The WHOQoL BREF mean score of various domains of 
physical health, psychological, social relationship and environmental was 
35.70 ± 12.14, 44.20 ± 13.28, 44.28 ± 15.10 and 40.07 ± 13.36 respectively. The 
thematic analysis revealed, difficulty in continuing education and employment, 
changing jobs, the need to travel long distances to reach dialysis facilities 
and hardship due to COVID-19 pandemic as recurring challenges among caregivers.
CONCLUSION: Caregivers of Hemodialysis patients had significant caregiver burden 
and poor QoL. Regular assessment and special attention are needed for these 
caregivers.

BACKGROUND: Peritoneal effusion is a rare but potentially life-threatening 
complication. This article aims to report two cases of massive peritoneal 
effusion following hip arthroscopy, both of whom had favorable outcomes.
CASE PRESENTATION: Two patients of Han Chinese ethnicity underwent hip 
arthroscopy under epidural anesthesia. Case 1 was a 49-year-old female who had a 
right acetabular labral tear and cyst, while Case 2 was a 69-year-old female who 
had left hip femoroacetabular impingement. Both surgeries used standard 
anterolateral and anterior approaches with 18 L and 24 L of irrigation fluid at 
100 mmHg pressure, respectively. During surgery, both patients developed severe 
abdominal distension; Case 2 also experienced transient hemodynamic instability. 
Imaging results confirmed extensive fluid accumulation in the abdominal and 
pelvic cavities. Both patients were treated with diuretics (furosemide), 
gastrointestinal motility regulators (trimebutine maleate), and intermittent 
enemas. Case 1 urinated approximately 3000 mL, and Case 2 urinated 1500 mL. 
Follow-up imaging results showed significant reduction in fluid accumulation, 
and both were discharged without further complications.
CONCLUSION: Large peritoneal effusion after hip arthroscopy is a rare but 
serious complication that can lead to intra-abdominal hypertension. Surgeons 
should be careful, especially in patients with prior abdominal surgeries or 
prolonged procedures near the iliopsoas tendon sheath, and take preventive 
measures such as minimizing perfusion pressure and monitoring vital signs.

BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are critical assessment tools for 
clinical practice, observational studies, and interventional trials. While 
families of children with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) and 
SJIA-associated lung disease (SJIA-LD) report significant limitations in their 
quality of life, existing PROs for juvenile idiopathic arthritis may not 
properly measure the full impact of these disorders. Our objective was to 
utilize a newly developed lung symptom survey as well as existing, validated 
Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures in 
children with SJIA with and without LD.
METHODS: Participants were parents/guardians of SJIA patients ≤ 18 years and 
were invited to participate using the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical 
Center (CCHMC) JIA Registry, and memberships in the Systemic JIA Foundation, and 
SJIA Facebook Group. Participants provided proxy-reports for their child using 
several PRO questionnaires [CCHMC Lung Symptom Survey; PROMIS Asthma Impact, 
Sleep Disturbance, Sleep Impairment Forms] and selected demographic and SJIA 
specific information.
RESULTS: There were 139 responses, of which 40.3% (n = 57) reported some lung 
disease including 12.9% (n = 20) with interstitial lung disease (ILD), pulmonary 
alveolar proteinosis (PAP) and/or pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH). All SJIA 
patients with any lung disease and those with ILD/PAP/PAH had significantly 
higher total questionnaire scores than patients without lung disease on the 
CCHMC Lung Symptoms Survey. Both the full survey and individual questions showed 
good ability to distinguish patients with ILD/PAP/PAH from those without (area 
under the curve (AUC) > 0.7). The majority of patients reported some level of 
sleep disturbance (n = 71/139 = 51.1%) and sleep impairment 53.2% (n = 74) 
regardless of presence or absence of lung disease, including moderate to severe 
sleep impairment and/or disturbance in 48% of SJIA patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Children with SJIA and lung problems had higher scores on the CCHMC 
Lung Symptom Survey; however, these measures did not discriminate between 
SJIA-LD and other pulmonary conditions such as asthma. Based on PROMIS measures, 
a majority of children with SJIA had sleep disturbance and impairment, 
regardless of steroid use or presence of lung disease.

Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) is common in critically ill patients and 
associated with increased morbidity and mortality. While intravesical manometry 
is the gold standard for measuring intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), its 
applicability may be limited in some clinical settings. This study evaluated the 
accuracy of a noninvasive bedside method combining physical examination and 
ultrasonography to assess the ratio of the maximal anteroposterior to transverse 
abdominal diameter (AP-T ratio) for detecting IAH. This cross-sectional 
diagnostic study was conducted in the surgical ICU of a tertiary care hospital. 
Intravesical pressure was measured as the reference standard. The AP-T ratio was 
assessed at the L2 level by two blinded investigators. Among 67 patients, 18 
were diagnosed with IAH. The AP-T ratio showed a strong correlation with IAP 
(r = 0.70, P < 0.001). An AP-T ratio ≥ 0.56 demonstrated 83% sensitivity, 84% 
specificity, and an AUROC of 0.84 for detecting IAH. After adjusting for BMI, 
the association remained significant. Diagnostic performance was highest in 
patients with normal BMI. The AP-T ratio was predominantly influenced by the 
anteroposterior diameter. This simple, noninvasive technique may serve as a 
practical alternative when standard IAP measurements are not feasible. Further 
validation in patients with severe IAH or abdominal compartment syndrome is 
warranted.Thai Clinical Trials Registry reference number TCTR20220831002.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Pregnancy is a critical period during which maternal diet 
may impact offspring growth and future health. The EAT-Lancet commission 
promotes a plant-based diet pattern for meeting environmental and health 
challenges. EAT-Lancet diet scores have been developed however, thus far they 
have not been examined in the context of maternal-child health. We investigated 
adherence to EAT-Lancet diet recommendations during pregnancy and associations 
with offspring birth outcomes and childhood adiposity. The hypothesis tested was 
that greater adherence is not related to adverse outcomes.
METHODS: This study included mother-child pairs (n = 1,052) from the Lifeways 
Cross-generational cohort, in Ireland. Maternal EAT-Lancet diet score was 
derived from an early pregnancy validated food frequency questionnaire. 
Correlation analysis examined relationships with other diet scores (Healthy 
Eating Index (HEI-2015), Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, and 
energy adjusted-Dietary Inflammatory Index (E-DII). Logistic and linear 
regression analyses examined associations with offspring birth outcomes and 
childhood adiposity and weight status at age 5 and 9 years, with adjustment for 
energy intake and potential confounders.
RESULTS: The EAT-Lancet diet score (mean ± SD 21.0 ± 4.1) was moderately 
positively correlated with HEI-2015 and DASH scores (ρ > 0.5) and negatively 
correlated with dietary inflammation (E-DII (ρ < - 0.5, all p-value < 0.001)). 
Greater adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet recommendations was associated with 
higher intake of most micronutrients (except for retinol, riboflavin, vitamin 
B12 and calcium which were significantly lower). In energy-adjusted models, 
maternal EAT-Lancet diet score was positively associated with offspring birth 
weight (β 8.77, 95% CI 0.35-17.19, p = 0.04), length (β 0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.1, 
p = 0.01), head circumference (β 0.04, 95% CI 0.01-0.07, p = 0.01) and lower 
likelihood of having a low birth weight (Odds ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.85-0.99, 
p = 0.01). These associations did not withstand adjustment for additional 
confounders.
CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to EAT-Lancet diet recommendations during pregnancy was 
not associated with adverse short or long-term offspring outcomes. Further 
examination in other cohorts with more diverse diets, and with additional health 
outcomes, is warranted.

The APOE ε4 genetic variant is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is increasingly being implicated in other 
neurodegenerative diseases. Using the Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics 
Consortium SomaScan dataset covering 1,346 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 9,924 
plasma samples, we used machine learning-based proteome profiling to identify an 
APOE ε4 proteomic signature shared across individuals with AD, frontotemporal 
dementia (FTD), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), Parkinson's disease (PD), 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and nonimpaired controls. This signature was 
enriched in pro-inflammatory immune and infection pathways as well as immune 
cells, including monocytes, T cells and natural killer cells. Analysis of the 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex proteome for 262 donors from the Accelerating 
Medicines Partnership for AD UPenn Proteomics Study revealed a consistent APOE 
ε4 phenotype, independent of neurodegenerative pathology, including amyloid-β 
tau and gliosis for all diseases, as well as TDP-43 in ALS and FTD cases, and 
α-synuclein in PD and PDD cases. While systemic proteomic changes were 
consistent across APOE ε4 carriers, their relationship with clinical and 
lifestyle factors, such as hypertension and smoking, varied by disease. These 
findings suggest APOE ε4 confers a systemic biological vulnerability that is 
necessary but not sufficient for neurodegeneration, emphasizing the need to 
consider gene-environment interactions. Overall, our study reveals a conserved 
APOE ε4-associated pro-inflammatory immune signature persistent across the 
brain, CSF and plasma irrespective of neurodegenerative disease, highlighting a 
fundamental, disease-independent biological vulnerability to neurodegeneration. 
This work reframes APOE ε4 as a pleiotropic immune modulator rather than an 
AD-specific risk gene, providing a foundation for precision biomarker 
development and early intervention strategies across neurodegenerative diseases.

Traumatic muscle injuries are common yet often lead to incomplete recovery, 
despite the high regenerative potential of skeletal muscle. A major obstacle is 
fibrosis, which replaces functional tissue with disorganised extracellular 
matrix, impairing contractility and healing. Central to this maladaptive 
response is the TGF-β1 pathway, a conserved fibrogenic signal also implicated in 
cardiac, hepatic, and renal fibrosis. This has prompted interest in repurposing 
antifibrotic agents, particularly angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), or 
sartans. These drugs, widely used for hypertension, inhibit TGF-β1 activation 
via AT1R antagonism. Preclinical studies in murine models have shown that 
sartans reduce collagen deposition, promote muscle regeneration, and improve 
functional outcomes after injury. Some also activate additional regenerative 
pathways, such as PPAR-γ. Although no clinical trials have evaluated ARBs for 
muscle injuries, preliminary data from orthopaedic settings suggest potential 
benefits. Given their safety, availability, and biological plausibility, sartans 
represent a promising avenue for therapeutic modulation of fibrosis in muscle 
trauma. Future research should clarify optimal timing, dosing, and patient 
selection to translate these findings into clinical practice.

This study investigated the prevalence and risk factors of moderate to severe 
hypertensive retinopathy among non-diabetic South Korean adults using data from 
the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2008-2011. 
Hypertensive retinopathy was defined through standardized retinal image grading. 
A multivariable logistic regression model was developed using weighted analysis 
and predictor selection based on pathophysiological relevance and 
multicollinearity diagnostics. Final model features included age, systolic blood 
pressure, HbA1c, total cholesterol, creatinine, and hemoglobin. Among 5,075 
participants, the weighted prevalence of moderate to severe hypertensive 
retinopathy was 0.8%. The prevalence rate increased with higher systolic blood 
pressure levels. The model demonstrated moderate discrimination, with an average 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.721 in 5-fold 
cross-validation and 0.679 in external validation using the KNHANES 2012 
dataset. External validation was performed using averaged predictions from the 
five internally validated models. The relatively low prevalence of hypertensive 
retinopathy compared to Western populations may reflect differences in 
hypertension control, lifestyle, or genetic susceptibility. Future research 
should explore retinal image analysis and longitudinal datasets to enhance early 
detection and clarify the systemic implications of hypertensive retinopathy.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic performance of splanchnic hemodynamic 
parameters measured with 4D flow MRI for diagnosis of severe portal hypertension 
(PH; hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) ≥ 12 mmHg), and prediction of liver 
decompensation in patients with chronic liver disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our single-center prospective study (2018-2022) enrolled 
patients undergoing transjugular liver biopsy with wedge HVPG measurement for 
abdominal 4D flow MRI (MRI-HVPG interval = 28 ± 18 (1-78) days). 4D flow MRI was 
acquired at 1.5 T, 10 min. after injection of gadoxetic acid, with a prototype 
sequence in coronal-oblique orientation (VENC = 60 cm/s). Multiple observers 
manually segmented the portal, superior mesenteric, splenic and middle hepatic 
veins, supraceliac aorta, celiac trunk, hepatic and splenic arteries. 
Time-averaged vessel cross-section area, through-plane time-averaged velocity 
and flow, and peak velocity were compared between patients with/without severe 
PH, and with/without future liver decompensation by Mann-Whitney U test and ROC 
analysis.
RESULTS: 50 patients (M/F: 26/24, age = 52 ± 15 years) were included, of which 
47 had clinical follow-up 1084 ± 618 days after MRI. Twenty-three of 50 (46%) 
patients had PH, 8/50 (16%) had severe PH, and 12/47 (26%) had decompensation. 
Celiac trunk peak velocity [AUC (95% CI) = 0.90 (0.80-0.99)] and superior 
mesenteric vein area [AUC (95% CI) = 0.88 (0.77-0.99)] identified severe PH with 
the highest diagnostic performance. A logistic regression model combining celiac 
trunk peak velocity and superior mesenteric vein flow identified severe PH with 
AUC (95% CI) = 0.95 (0.88-1.00), sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 89%. Hepatic 
[AUC (95% CI) = 0.74 (0.57-0.92)] and splenic artery [AUC (95% CI) = 0.74 
(0.52-0.96)] area, celiac trunk [AUC (95% CI) = 0.70 (0.51-0.89)] and superior 
mesenteric vein [AUC (95% CI) = 0.72 (0.55-0.89)] flow predicted liver 
decompensation with good diagnostic performance.
CONCLUSION: Splanchnic 4D flow MRI measurements have excellent performance for 
diagnosing severe PH and good performance for predicting liver decompensation.
KEY POINTS: Question Noninvasive detection of severe portal hypertension 
(hepatic venous pressure gradient ≥ 12 mmHg) is important to prevent bleeding, 
decompensation, and death in patients with chronic liver disease. Findings 
Splanchnic hemodynamic measurements by 4D flow MRI can identify patients with 
severe portal hypertension and predict liver decompensation with excellent/good 
diagnostic performance. Clinical relevance 4D flow MRI can potentially be 
integrated into the clinical MRI protocols of patients with liver cirrhosis.

BACKGROUND: Stroke remains a leading global cause of disability and mortality 
with over 100 million patients affected worldwide. Its incidence has risen in 
recent decades, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), due to 
limited education, healthcare, and effective prevention measures. This study 
investigates the association between ethnicity and outcomes of stroke in Qatar, 
a country with a heterogeneous population.
METHODS: Data from 18,174 stroke patients admitted to Hamad General Hospital 
from 2014 to 2024 were analyzed. We assessed patient characteristics, stroke 
types, comorbidities, and outcomes using the NIH Stroke Scale and modified 
Rankin Scale (mRS).
RESULTS: There were significant ethnic differences in stroke presentation and 
outcomes. Middle Easterns were older (59.7 ± 14.2) than South East Asian 
(50.1 ± 11.7) and Far Eastern (47.5 ± 9.85) patients; p < 0.001. Middle Eastern 
patients had a higher prevalence of stroke risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, 
obesity) and stroke mimics (39.8%) than Southeast Asian (21.7%) and Far Eastern 
(27.7%) patients (p < 0.0001). Far Eastern patients demonstrated a higher 
incidence (17.6%) of intracerebral hemorrhage compared to Middle Easterns (6.2%) 
and East Asians (10.6%); p < 0.0001. However, ischemic stroke was more common 
among Southeast Asians (58.6%) than Middle Eastern (43.8%) and Far Eastern 
(44.4%) patients; p < 0.0001. Lastly, there were significant differences in 
outcomes as measured by mortality and the mRS.
CONCLUSION: There are significant ethnic differences in stroke presentation, 
management, and outcomes in Qatar, some of which may reflect underlying 
disparities driven by social and structural inequities. While genetic 
differences play a role, early management of vascular risk factors is a crucial, 
preventable measure to reduce stroke burden in LMICs and improve health 
outcomes.

Despite the Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI) serving as a crucial prognostic 
marker for predicting survival outcomes in cancer patients, its association with 
the risk of Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is not well comprehended. We hypothesized 
that lower PNI levels are associated with a higher risk of CRC. The datasets 
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) spanning from 
2007 to 2016 were employed in this study, incorporating data on demographics, 
laboratory tests, and questionnaires. Participants aged ≥ 20 years were 
included, while those with missing tumor history or incomplete laboratory data 
for PNI calculation (serum albumin or lymphocyte count) were excluded. A total 
of 26,229 participants who met the inclusion criteria were evaluated, of which 
176 had a history of CRC. The PNI was calculated as 0.005 × absolute lymphocyte 
count + 10 × serum albumin, and categorized into quartiles. CRC status was 
determined via self-reported medical history. To investigate the linear 
relationship between PNI and CRC, multivariable logistic regression models, 
restricted cubic spline analysis, and subgroup analyses were used. Covariates 
were adjusted using multiple imputation, and all analyses were conducted using 
DecisionLinnc v1.0. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. The average 
PNI score was 42.55 ± 3.42. Fully adjusted multivariable logistic regression 
models identified a significant inverse relationship between higher PNI scores 
and lower odds of CRC. Specifically, each one-unit increase in PNI was 
associated with a 6.43% reduction in the odds of CRC [OR: 0.9357; 95% CI: 
0.8942, 0.9807; p = 0.005]. Restricted cubic spline analysis further validated a 
linear association between PNI and CRC risk. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that 
the association remained consistent across factors including gender, age, 
marital status, education level, BMI, alcohol consumption, smoking habits, 
history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. Males exhibited a more 
pronounced inverse correlation between PNI and CRC risk. Higher PNI scores are 
independently associated with reduced odds of CRC. PNI may serve as a valuable 
risk biomarker for identifying individuals at elevated CRC risk and could 
enhance large-scale screening strategies.

The National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS), which focuses on 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs), their risk factors and healthcare demand, is a 
cross-sectional, nationwide, population-based survey conducted every four-year 
cycle since 2011. NHMS 2023 was the 7th cycle of NCDs, their risk factors and 
healthcare demand, which aimed to monitor trends in diseases and healthcare 
utilisation. This article outlines the methodology, sociodemographic 
characteristics, and overall findings from the population surveyed in 2023 
regarding NCDs, their risk factors, and various health-related topics. This 
survey utilised a two-stage stratified random sampling design and encompassed 
fifteen main scopes, with sample sizes calculated to meet the specific 
requirements of each scope. Conducted from July to September 2023, it involved 
the random selection of 499 enumeration blocks(EBs) by the Department of 
Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) across all states and federal territories in 
Malaysia. The step resulted in the selection of 5,988 living quarters (LQs). 
Data collection methods included validated questionnaires administered through 
face-to-face interviews and self-administered questionnaires, alongside clinical 
assessments and blood investigations using calibrated devices. To ensure the 
high quality of the collected data, we implemented stringent quality control 
measures. Furthermore, we applied complex sampling analyses to ensure that the 
findings accurately represented the population in Malaysia. The survey received 
responses from 13,616 individuals out of the 5,006 LQs that were successfully 
visited, resulting in an overall response rate of the survey of 83.2%, which 
includes individuals aged 5 years and above. A substantial segment of the 
population lived in urban regions, comprising 77.6% of the total. About half of 
the population consisted of males (51.9%), Malay (54.6%), and individuals who 
had attained secondary education (54.2%). Additionally, 20.0% of the population 
were within the age range of 30 to 39 years. The weighted prevalence of diabetes 
was 15.6%, hypertension 29.2%, hypercholesterolaemia 33.3%, overweight and 
obesity 54.4%. Depression among adults was 4.6%, while mental health problems 
among children were reported at 16.5%. The current tobacco smokers prevalence 
was 19.0%, and 29.9% of adults in Malaysia were physically inactive. The known 
asthma prevalence among adults was 6.2%, while the current asthma among children 
was 3.4%. Additionally, 37.7% of adults experienced sleep insufficiency. The 
results indicate that the higher proportion of diabetes, hypertension, and 
hypercholesterolaemia, particularly among the young age group, and the high 
prevalence of overweight and obesity, as well as mental health problems,  are 
making the healthcare system deal with more non-communicable diseases, 
complications, and problems. The methodology of this survey is robust for a 
population-based study. We took comprehensive steps to ensure the validity and 
reliability of the findings. The findings indicate an urgent need for targeted 
public health interventions to address the escalating health issues. By focusing 
on prevention and early intervention strategies, we can mitigate the impact of 
NCDs on the healthcare system and improve overall population health.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of percutaneous 
ultrasound-guided radiofrequency (US-guided RFA) as a potential treatment for 
unilateral isolated Aldosterone-producing adenomas (APA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
Clinical data from patients with APA who underwent US-guided RFA between January 
2020 and June 2024 at the Fuzhou University Affiliated Provincial Hospital and 
the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University were retrospectively 
analysed. Technical success (complete tumor ablation and normalization of the 
serum aldosterone-renin ratio [ARR] at 3-6 months post-RFA), blood pressure 
control, complication rates, and RFA-related parameters were assessed. 
Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to compare tumor volume changes before ablation 
and at each follow-up.
RESULTS: A total of 36 patients (Median age, 49.5±5.3 years; 13 men, 23 women) 
were evaluated. All patients achieved successful single-session ablation, with 
complete biochemical remission of primary aldosteronism (36/36). The 
hypertension control rate was 66.7% (24/36). The complication rate was 13.89% 
(five patients), primarily fever caused by postoperative infection. A transient 
significant increase in blood pressure occurred in 10 patients (27.8%). No 
short-term recurrence was observed.
CONCLUSION: This two-centre study provides evidence that US-guided RFA is an 
effective and safe treatment option in selected patients with unilateral 
isolated APA.

This article explores the role of genetics in kidney stones and kidney cancer 
predisposition, focusing on monogenic genetic causes that can be identified 
through genetic testing. We provide a comprehensive review of monogenic causes 
of kidney stones and kidney cancer as well as the current treatment options. A 
curated list of 64 monogenic causes of kidney stones, including 11 provisional 
genes, and 50 genes for kidney cancer predisposition, also including 11 
provisional genes, is presented. Selected genes are discussed in detail, 
highlighting their clinical presentations, underlying genetic mechanisms, and 
available treatment options. These include gene-specific therapies, such as 
drugs targeting AGXT for primary hyperoxaluria type 1 and VHL for renal cell 
carcinoma, alongside nonspecific treatments for conditions such as Bartter 
syndrome and Lynch syndrome. As gene discovery continues to progress, it holds 
the potential to inform future preventive guidelines, novel therapeutic 
approaches, and precision medicine strategies, ultimately advancing the field of 
nephrology and improving patient outcomes. Semin Nephrol 36:x-xx © 20XX Elsevier

OBJECTIVES: Cardiopulmonary involvement (CPI) is a major cause of morbidity and 
mortality in systemic sclerosis (SSc). The 6 min walk test (6MWT) is widely used 
to assess functional capacity, but its ability to detect incident CPI remains 
uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate the determinants and trajectory of 6MWT 
parameters over time and its diagnostic utility in identifying incident CPI in 
SSc.
METHODS: Two large prospective SSc cohorts were analysed. Multivariable 
regression identified factors associated with baseline 6MWT parameters. 
Longitudinal changes were assessed using linear mixed models, and diagnostic 
accuracy for incident CPI was evaluated using predefined thresholds for a 
decline in 6 min walking distance (6MWD) (≥33 m) and oxygen desaturation (<95%).
RESULTS: Patients with CPI walked 89 m less than those without (95% CI -116 to 
61) and exercise-induced desaturation was more frequent in CPI (OR 17.0, 95% CI 
8.7 to 33). Over time, 6MWD increased slightly by 3.0 m per year (95% CI 1.7 to 
4.3). Linear mixed model analysis showed an independent association of 6MWD 
(-33 m, 95% CI -45 to 21) and occurrence of exercise-induced desaturation (OR 
15, 95% CI 8.5 to 30) in patients with CPI. A ≥33 m decline in 6MWD had 34.7% 
sensitivity and 79% specificity for detecting incident CPI, while new 
desaturation had 10.6% sensitivity and 92.6% specificity.
CONCLUSION: 6MWT parameters are associated with CPI in SSc. A stable 6MWD and 
absence of desaturation may help rule out CPI, but their low sensitivity 
suggests that 6MWT alone is insufficient for screening and should be 
complemented by additional diagnostic modalities.

BACKGROUND: There is a correlation between dyslipidemia and elevated blood 
pressure, but the relationship between different lipid parameters and elevated 
blood pressure is inconsistent. Therefore, understanding the impact of 
dyslipidemia on blood pressure is significant for the prevention and control of 
ASCVD. Our study is aimed at assessing longitudinally the correlation between 
lipid parameters and the incidence of stage 1 hypertension in a large Chinese 
community population.
METHODS: This community-based cohort study conducted from 2011 to 2014-2016 
included 2,843 eligible individuals aged 40 years or older. The diagnosis of 
stage 1 hypertension was systolic blood pressure (SBP) 130~139 mmHg and/or 
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 80~89 mmHg. We collect data through standardized 
questionnaires and clinical and biochemical measurements conducted in unified 
institutions. The relationship between lipid parameters and risk of stage 1 
hypertension were estimated using multiple Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 388 subjects (13.7%) developed stage 1 
hypertension. Incidence of stage 1 hypertension gradually increased with the 
quartiles of triglycerides (TG) and the ratio of TG to high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (TG/HDL-C, all P < 0.0001). Multiple Cox regression analyses 
indicated that, compared to the quartile 1 of TG/HDL-C, quartile 4 was 
associated with higher risk of incident stage 1 hypertension (model 1: HR = 
2.06, 95% CI 1.49-2.84; model 2: HR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.41-2.70; model 3: HR = 
1.48, 95% CI 1.05-2.09).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study findings suggest that TG/HDL-C is independently 
associated with the incidence of stage 1 hypertension in the Chinese middle-aged 
and elderly population.

OBJECTIVE: The magnitude and persistence of diseases and multimorbidity between 
females and males are different. This study comprehensively quantified sex 
differences in the onset and progression of 108 major physical and mental 
diseases to multimorbidity through adulthood in Chinese population.
DESIGN: Quantitative analysis of real-world linked electronic health records.
SETTING: Linked health records from 160 health facilities across primary, 
secondary and tertiary healthcare, comprising routinely collected electronic 
health records from the whole urban residents of Yichang, China between 1 
January 2016 and 31 December 2019.
PARTICIPANTS: 684 455 urban residents aged 20 years and above with documented 
health records during the study period.
MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The cumulative incidence, relative risks (RR) and 95% 
CIs, period prevalence, median age at disease diagnosis and the prevalence of 
multimorbidity of 108 major physical and mental diseases were computed. All 
analyses were stratified by sex and age groups.
RESULTS: The analysis included 684 455 individuals (54.8% females, mean age: 
46.9), among whom 46.3% had multimorbidity, with a higher prevalence in females 
(47.6%) than males (44.9%). The chronological disease map revealed stark 
differences between females and males, with notable lower risk of obstructive 
sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS, RR: 0.03, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.11) for 
young adults, oesophageal cancer (RR: 0.02, 95% CI: 0.0 to 0.17) for mid-age 
adults and remarkable higher risk of lupus (RR: 8.8, 95% CI: 2.7 to 29.0) for 
older adults of females. Males exhibited an incidence surge in hypertension, 
diabetes, coronary disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease a decade 
earlier than females, while females had a life-long higher prevalence in 
immune-mediated diseases and urinary disorders. For the new incident diseases, 
the manifestation of eating disorders, anaemia and urinary incontinence was 
recorded 20 years earlier in females; whereas, males were diagnosed with 
hyperuricaemia, OSAHS and schizophrenia at younger ages.
CONCLUSIONS: The significant variations in disease nature and trajectory between 
sexes underscore the urgent needs for tailored prevention strategies and 
appropriate health resources allocation. Sex differences in disease profile 
should be considered to delay disease and multimorbidity progression, ultimately 
promoting health equity.

OBJECTIVES: Pre-eclampsia causes significant maternal and perinatal morbidity 
and mortality. It also causes changes in the cardiovascular, endothelial and 
metabolic systems, from which women may not fully recover after delivery. This 
study examined the association between the time of onset of pre-eclampsia and 
the risk for cardiovascular disease (using glucose tolerance, lipid profile and 
blood pressure) and renal function at 6 weeks post partum.
STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi-Araba, Mother and Child Centre, 
Gbaja, Surulere and Lagos Island Maternity Hospital, Lagos, Nigeria.
PARTICIPANTS: 44 women with pre-eclampsia were studied and data on their 
sociodemographic characteristics, gestational age at diagnosis and blood 
pressure were collected on admission. They were followed up through delivery 
till 6 weeks post partum, when blood pressure check, 75 g oral glucose tolerance 
test, fasting lipid profile and serum creatinine were done.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The exposure was pre-eclampsia. The outcomes were 
cardiovascular disease risk markers, viz persistent hypertension, glucose 
intolerance and dyslipidaemia, and renal function at 6 weeks post partum in 
women who had pre-eclampsia.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Data were analysed using Stata V.16.1. Mann Whitney-U test 
was used to compare medians and Fisher's exact test was used to compare the 
categorical variables.
RESULTS: Of the women studied, 13 (29.5%) had early onset pre-eclampsia and 31 
(70.5%) had late onset pre-eclampsia. Mean gestational age at diagnosis was 
30.8±1.57 weeks in women with early-onset pre-eclampsia and 35.6±1.26 weeks in 
women with late-onset pre-eclampsia (p<0.001). There was no significant 
difference in terms of disease severity in women who had early-onset compared 
with late-onset disease. Of the cardiovascular risk markers assessed at 6 weeks 
post partum, only serum triglyceride was found to be statistically higher in 
women with early onset compared with late onset pre-eclampsia, median values of 
135 mg/dL (130-182 mg/dL) vs 128 mg/dL (121-139 mg/dL), p = 0.008. Only eight 
(18.2%) of the pre-eclamptic women became normotensive at the end of puerperium.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of persistent hypertension at 6 weeks post partum is 
high in women with pre-eclampsia. Serum triglyceride concentration was 
significantly higher in early onset compared with late onset pre-eclampsia; 
subsequent studies powered to determine the full cardiovascular risk and how 
long to follow postnatal women up will be beneficial.

This study aimed to explore the effects of Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang1-7) on 
electrophysiological remodeling of hypertensive hypertrophic myocardium in 
spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Thirty male SHR rats were equally divided 
into three groups: SHR control group (SHRC) treated with saline; Ang1-7 group 
(SHR-A) treated with Ang1-7[25 μg·(kg min)-1] and Ang1-7 blocker group (SHRB) 
treated with A779 [72 μg·(kg min)-1]. Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats (n = 10) were used 
as a normotensive group. The treatment period was 5 weeks. Systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured. 
Echocardiography was used to evaluate cardiac function. The ventricular myocytes 
were isolated for evaluation of electrophysiological remodeling of myocardium 
using microelectrode and patch clamp techniques. When compared with those in WKY 
rats before treatment, systolic and diastolic pressures were significantly 
higher in SHR (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001 respectively), left ventricular 
end-diastolic diameter (LVEDd) was significantly lower (P < 0.05), while 
diastolic interventricular septum thickness (IVSd), diastolic left ventricular 
posterior wall thickness (LVPWd) were significantly greater in SHR (P < 0.01). 
After 5 weeks of treatment, compared with SHR-C group, SBP, DBP, IVSd, LVPWd in 
SHR-A group were lower significantly (P < 0.05), while SBP in SHR-B group was 
significantly higher (P < 0.05). Compared with WKY group, the resting potential 
(RP), action potential amplitude (APA) and transient sodium current (INa-T) in 
SHR group were significantly lower (P < 0.05), and the action potential duration 
(APD20, APD50 and APD90) in SHR group was greater (P < 0.05). After Ang1-7 
intervention, RP, APA and INa-T were significantly greater in SHR-A than those 
in SHR-C (P < 0.05), and APD in SHR-A significantly lower than that in SHR-C 
(P < 0.05). Taken together, these results demonstrated that Ang1-7 can not only 
decrease the blood pressure, but reverse the myocardial hypertrophy and 
electrophysiological remodeling as well in SHR rats.

(Val)Ganciclovir (VGCV) is utilised for the prevention and treatment of 
cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in pediatric patients who have undergone renal 
transplants. Due to toxic side effects, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is 
recommended, especially in vulnerable populations. Microsampling offers 
collecting small volumes of body fluids (<50µL), making it ideal for TDM 
service. This study aimed to develop and clinically validate two microsampling 
techniques - MitraTM and Capitainer®- employing volumetric absorptive 
microsampling (VAMS) and quantitative dried blood spot (qDBS) methods, 
respectively. Additionally, reference methods for analysing GCV in whole blood 
and plasma were validated. The LC-MS/MS multi-matrix method for quantifying GCV 
was validated using a calibration range of 0.01-25 mg/L in accordance with ICH 
M10 and Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The calculated accuracies and 
precisions for all tested matrices were within 15%. No significant matrix and 
carryover effects were observed. Clinical validation demonstrated the efficacy 
of the examined microsampling devices in practice, highlighting the feasibility 
of home-based self-sampling. The developed methodologies were utilised to assess 
GCV levels in clinical samples from pediatric renal transplant recipients 
receiving VGCV treatment within a preemptive or prophylactic CMV protocol. The 
results were clinically evaluated through regression and bias estimation 
analyses, confirming a high level of correlation between GCV levels in the 
tested matrices. In conclusion, the newly developed, straightforward, and robust 
multi-matrix LC-MS/MS method has been effectively validated and integrated into 
clinical practice. For the first time in the literature, we demonstrated the 
analytical and clinical feasibility of tested microsampling devices for routine 
GCV concentration monitoring.

BACKGROUND: Multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome (MCS) is a form of severe 
hypertriglyceridemia (sHTG) associated with increased risk of acute pancreatitis 
and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). We recently reported 
suggestive evidence that DNA methylation (DNAm) contribute to the sHTG phenotype 
in MCS. While few predictors of acute pancreatitis were previously identified in 
MCS, predictors of ASCVD in MCS remain mostly unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To study the factors associated with previous history of ASCVD in MCS 
patients.
METHODS: A total of 114 patients with MCS were included in this retrospective 
study. Prevalence of ASCVD was determined at the baseline visit and defined as 
any atherosclerotic event: angina, myocardial infarction, coronary angioplasty, 
coronary bypass surgery, claudication, peripheral angioplasty, peripheral 
arterial surgery, transient ischemic attack, stroke, carotid endarterectomy, and 
artery stenosis (>50 %). DNAm level at ABCG1 (cg06500161), CPT1A (cg00574958), 
and SREBF1 (cg11024682) candidate gene loci was quantified using pyrosequencing 
of bisulfite-treated DNA.
RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that age, ABCG1 and SREBF1 DNAm level, and 
the presence of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and maximal TG 
level > 40 mmol/L were associated with previous history of ASCVD. Multivariate 
analysis showed that age (OR 1.11 [1.04-1.18], p = 0.0006), SREBF1 DNAm levels 
(OR 1.12 [1.03-1.24], p = 0.01), the presence of a maximal TG level > 40 mmol/L 
(OR 0.13 [0.02-0.90], p = 0.04), and obesity (OR 3.32 [1.00-11.19, p = 0.05] 
were independently associated with history of ASCVD and explained 44.8 % of the 
variability in the prevalence of ASCVD (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: This study shows that SREBF1 DNAm levels are independently 
associated with prevalence of ASCVD in MCS patients. It suggests that further 
studies of epivariations may contribute to better understand the clinical 
heterogeneity seen in MCS patients.

AIM: The aim of the study was to detect cardiac repolarization changes and the 
risk of arrhythmias in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) and sickle 
thalassemia using echocardiography and electrocardiography (ECG).
METHODS: This is an observational case-control study that compared 20 patients 
with SCD and 20 patients with sickle thalassemia who regularly follow in the 
outpatient hematology clinic of Fayoum University Hospital with 40 healthy 
controls with history of non-hematological or cardiac illness who attended the 
general outpatient clinic from November 2022 to July 2023. All patients were 
evaluated clinically and by routine echocardiography, tissue Doppler imaging 
(TDI), and long-strip ECG.
RESULTS: The QT, QT corrected (QTc), and QT dispersion (QTd) intervals were 
significantly higher in the case groups (all p = 0.001). There was a 
significantly higher T-wave peak-to-end interval (Tp-e) among sickle patients in 
comparison to controls. There was a statistically significant higher level of 
Tei index and velocity of the e' wave among each case group in comparison to the 
control group (p < 0.05). As regards QTc and QTd intervals, there was a 
statistically significant positive correlation with each of estimated pulmonary 
artery pressure (ESPAP), isovolumetric contraction time (IVCT), Tei index, and 
velocity of the s' wave among study groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of malignant arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death may occur 
in children with SCD and sickle thalassemia. They had longer QTc, QTd, and Tp-e 
intervals than healthy individuals. Prolonged QTc was significantly associated 
with increased left ventricular dimensions, pulmonary hypertension, and global 
myocardial dysfunction.

Germline loss-of-function mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA) genes are 
well-established as causative factors for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer 
(HBOC), conferring an approximately tenfold increased lifetime risk. The 
identification of BRCA mutations is essential for risk assessment and management 
in high-risk individuals and cancer patients. In this study, we utilized 
next-generation sequencing (NGS) to comprehensively analyze the entire coding 
regions of BRCA genes in a cohort of 100 unselected patients undergoing germline 
screening (average age ≤45 years and/or family history of related cancers). A 
total of twenty-two variants were identified, including thirteen pathogenic or 
likely pathogenic variants (PVs/LPVs) and nine variants of uncertain 
significance (VUSs). Notably, six novel variants (two in BRCA1 and four in 
BRCA2) were discovered. Molecular subtyping revealed that breast cancer (BC) 
patients with BRCA variants were predominantly human epidermal growth factor 
receptor-2 (HER2)-negative. Using in silico prediction tools, nine VUSs were 
reclassified, with functional impairment confirmed for the BRCA2 p.W2619C and 
BRCA2 p.N1023_I1024del variants. Functional assays demonstrated that the BRCA2 
p.W2619C variant significantly enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and 
invasion. Moreover, cells harboring the BRCA2 p.W2619C mutation exhibited 
increased sensitivity to Olaparib, suggesting potential therapeutic benefit from 
PARP inhibitors for patients with this variant. Our study identified six novel 
BRCA mutations and functionally validated the pathogenicity of the BRCA2 
p.W2619C variant, thereby advancing the understanding of BRCA-related cancer 
risk and supporting enhanced genetic counseling and testing strategies for 
at-risk populations.

Cross-sectional imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of 
both congenital and acquired hepatic vascular abnormalities. Congenital vascular 
anomalies, such as arteriovenous malformations, portal vein and hepatic vein 
anomalies, often present with nonspecific symptoms and require precise imaging 
for accurate assessment. Acquired hepatic vascular conditions, including 
cirrhosis-related vascular changes, portal hypertension, and vascular lesions, 
can lead to clinical complications and may necessitate timely intervention. 
Cross-sectional imaging techniques like computed tomography (CT) and magnetic 
resonance (MR) imaging offer detailed visualization of these abnormalities, 
aiding in the detection, characterization, and monitoring of disease 
progression. The integration of dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging techniques 
further enhances the ability to evaluate blood flow, vessel architecture, and 
the impact of vascular abnormalities on liver function. Early and accurate 
detection of both congenital and acquired hepatic vascular abnormalities through 
cross-sectional imaging is vital for optimizing patient outcomes, guiding 
therapeutic strategies, and preventing further complications.

OBJECTIVE: Chronic kidney disease affects 1 in 7 people in the US, and 1 in 6 US 
Veterans. Treatment for kidney failure includes home dialysis, which, despite 
its benefits, is infrequently used. A major barrier to using home dialysis is 
receiving adequate education about it. This research investigates how patient 
education affects treatment choices of Veterans with kidney disease.
METHODS: As part of a randomized control trial, we interviewed 42 US Veterans 
with advanced chronic kidney disease. An interview based on the Theoretical 
Domains Framework elicited on the impact of study education on decision-making. 
Reflexive thematic analysis attuned to cultural model theory-the beliefs which 
motivate behavior held by groups-was used for analysis.
RESULTS: There were four themes in the data: 1) Pre-education, patients had a 
lack of knowledge of kidney disease and treatment. 2) After education, patients 
reacted with surprise and then coping actions. 3) Patients experienced positive 
emotions and beliefs from education and coping. 4) Patients dealt with diagnosis 
and engaged in treatment decision-making. Ten cognitive, emotional, and 
behavioral subthemes were seen. Themes were found in the interviews of 76 % of 
participants receiving comprehensive patient education, but only 27 % of those 
receiving enhanced usual care.
CONCLUSION: We provide a mechanistic understanding of the process through which 
education affects cultural models to support patients' decision-making by 
preparing and equipping them to confront the future. We note that cultural model 
changes occur across longitudinal stages, which are recursive with one another 
and dynamic based on the individual case.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Because optimal dialysis outcomes require time to plan, 
create, and heal from dialysis access surgery, practitioners should provide 
patient education 6 months prior to estimated start to account for time needed 
for cultural model change. Helping patients know what to expect in terms of 
their own changing understanding may further support.

BACKGROUND: Falls are thought to be common in patients undergoing maintenance 
hemodialysis, but little is known about their frequency or outcomes. In this 
prospective study, we sought to increase our knowledge regarding the incidence, 
timing, circumstances, and outcomes of falls in this population.
METHODS: Between January 2021 and April 2023, adults undergoing maintenance 
hemodialysis from 103 U.S. dialysis facilities were enrolled in the HOPE 
Consortium trial, which randomized participants with moderate or severe chronic 
pain to a pain coping skills cognitive behavioral therapy intervention or usual 
care. Occurrence of falls was a pre-specified trial outcome. The research team 
inquired about falls at each four-week follow-up visit during the 36-week study. 
Multivariable regression was used to explore associations of demographic and 
clinical characteristics, including patient-reported symptoms, with fall risk.
RESULTS: Of 643 trial participants, 178 (28%) experienced 293 falls over a 
cumulative follow-up period of 429 participant-years for an overall rate of 0.68 
falls per participant-year (95% CI: 0.61, 0.76). Accidents were the most 
frequent cause of falls (38%). It was rare for falls to be related to the 
hemodialysis treatment or to occur in the hemodialysis unit. Of the 293 falls, 
36 (12%) were evaluated in the emergency department without subsequent 
hospitalization, 41 (14%) resulted in a hospital admission, and 19 (7%) led to a 
fracture. In multivariable analyses, neither demographic characteristics 
severity of pain symptoms or medication use such as opioids at enrollment was 
associated with the fall risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Falls were common in this cohort of maintenance hemodialysis 
patients with chronic pain, occurring in 28% of individuals during a planned 
follow-up of 36 weeks. Falls rarely occurred in the dialysis unit, with the vast 
majority occurring at participants' homes and due to accidental causes. There 
was no significant association between patient-reported symptoms or medication 
use and the risk of subsequent falls.

CONTEXT: Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) removes plasma proteins and other 
unwanted substances, causing non-specific alterations of plasma components. A 
previous study showed ∼70% reduction in vitamin D metabolites following a single 
TPE treatment, prompting further investigation into TPE's effects on vitamin D 
regulators and metabolites: calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and 
fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23).
OBJECTIVE: This study examined changes in plasma and effluent levels of total 
calcium, phosphate, PTH, and FGF-23 in persons undergoing TPE.
METHODS: Measurements were taken immediately before, immediately after, and at 
follow-up. Paired t-tests compared the percent changes in metabolites from pre- 
to post-TPE.
RESULTS: Study participants (N=42) had a mean age of 55 ± 16 years, 28 (67%) 
were female and 32 (76%) were white. TPE led to acute changes in calcium [-9%, 
(95% CI -11%, -8%)], phosphate [-14%, (-18%, -11%)], and FGF-23 [-12%, (-18%, 
-6%)] concentrations. In contrast, PTH levels increased [91% (63%, 119%)] from 
baseline to post-TPE. While most metabolites returned to baseline by the 
follow-up visit (median 4 [IQR 3,7] days), nearly 25% of patients experienced 
persistent asymptomatic hypocalcemia. This persistent calcium deficit was not 
fully corrected by continuous IV calcium gluconate infusions administered during 
the study, nor by the endogenously increased PTH levels.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the need for improved care protocols and 
vigilant monitoring of mineral metabolism TPE patients, especially those 
receiving long-term treatment. Further research is warranted to understand the 
enduring effects of TPE on mineral metabolism and develop strategies to prevent 
complications.

Introduction: Urine oxalate excretion influences the risk of calcium oxalate 
kidney stone formation and has been reported to positively correlate with body 
mass index (BMI) and body weight. The two major sources of urine oxalate are 
dietary oxalate absorption and endogenous oxalate synthesis (EOS). In this 
study, we investigated the association between EOS, as estimated by oxalate 
content of 24-hour urine collected while consuming an ultra-low oxalate diet, 
and measures of body size and composition. Methods: An analysis of prospectively 
performed studies conducted on adults consuming ultra-low oxalate diets between 
January 2018 and January 2025 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham was 
undertaken. All participants (n = 88) were healthy and had no history of kidney 
stone disease, hypertension, or diabetes. Participants underwent anthropomorphic 
measurements, and body composition was measured by bioelectrical impedance 
analysis. Urinary oxalate was measured by ion chromatography coupled to mass 
spectrometry. Results: Total urinary oxalate was positively correlated with body 
weight, BMI, lean body muscle mass, appendicular lean muscle mass, waist-to-hip 
ratio, and urinary creatinine excretion. There was no significant correlation 
between urinary oxalate excretion and body fat or age. Urinary oxalate excretion 
was different in males and females, even after adjusting for measures of lean 
body composition. Discussion: This analysis of low oxalate controlled diet 
studies in healthy participants suggests lean body mass, not body fat, is the 
major driver of EOS. This study also highlights that oxalate synthesis in lean 
body compartments is different in males and females.

Late prenatal diagnosis of complete pentalogy of Cantrell.

[Article in English]

Albrecht MEM, Sevillano Filho R, Araujo Júnior E.

Cantrell's pentalogy is a rare syndrome associated with a midline embryological 
defect involving a series of malformations: anomalies of the lower sternum, 
anterior diaphragm, heart, and anterior abdominal wall. It can be classified as 
complete, probable or partial, but the most important thing is to describe and 
understand the anomalies involved. We describe a case of a late diagnosis of 
Cantrell's pentalogy at 35 weeks and 5 days of pregnancy in a woman from the 
interior of Pará state, an Amazon Brazilian region. Fetal echocardiography 
confirmed the diagnosis of Cantrell's pentalogy with tetralogy of Fallot and 
ultrasound examination showing a bilateral clubfoot. Cesarean section was 
performed at 36 weeks because of pre-eclampsia superimposed on chronic arterial 
hypertension with signs of severity. The male newborn was delivered weighting 
2,320 grams. Postnatal echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis of Cantrell's 
pentalogy and karyotype was normal (46, XY). Infant was discharged at 47 days of 
age with good weight gain, artificial breastfeeding, and outpatient follow-up by 
the cardiology and cardiac surgery specialists.

The association between 1st trimester serum kisspeptin level and antenatal 
complications.

[Article in English]

Günday ÖK, Vurmaz A, Yılmazer M.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of serum kisspeptin (KP), 
measured in the 1st trimester (11-14 weeks), as a new biomarker that can predict 
antenatal complications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective case-control study of prospectively 
collected data. Blood samples of all patients (N = 124) were preserved at -70 °C 
for the assessment of serum KP-10 and KP-54 levels. The KP levels were analyzed 
for comparison among women who experienced complications including fetal growth 
retardation (FGR), pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), preterm delivery, 
gestational diabetes, and fetal death. The control group consisted of matching 
subjects who completed their pregnancies without problems. The predictive effect 
of serum KP on adverse pregnancy outcomes was investigated.
RESULTS: Among all adverse pregnancy outcomes, the KP-10 level was significantly 
higher in patients who developed FGR (P = 0.025). In the patient cohort affected 
by PIH, either accompanied by preeclampsia or standalone, there was a trend 
towards higher KP-10 levels (P = 0.059), although statistical significance was 
not achieved. However, regarding KP-10, the calculated cut-off value and the 
area under the curve (AUC) for predicting the onset of FGR were statistically 
significant (AUC: 0.684; P = 0.006). The model established with KP-10, PIH, and 
pregnancy associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) was found to be significant in 
predicting the development of FGR (P = 0.006; NPV: 98%; PPV: 21.4%; OR: 0.10; 
95% CI 0.016-0.611).
CONCLUSIONS: First trimester maternal serum KP levels may have the potential to 
be used as a 1st trimester biomarker that can predict the development of FGR.

Analysing risk factors for foetal growth outcomes - the influence of maternal 
conditions and congenital cytomegalovirus infection.

[Article in English]

Mandžáková M, Záhumenský J, Vajdová E, Matušíková Z, Rosoľanková M, Papcun P.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyse the risk factors differentiating small 
for gestational age (SGA) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) neonates.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective-prospective cohort study was conducted 
from 2019 to 2024 at the 2nd Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, 
University Hospital Bratislava. The study involved 174 term neonates from 
singleton pregnancies, including 125 SGA and 49 AGA infants. Various maternal, 
foetal, and placental risk factors were analysed, with a particular focus on 
congenital cytomegalovirus infection (cCMV).
RESULTS: Neonates' birth weights ranged from 1,480 to 4,470 grams. Of the risk 
factors assessed, only maternal COVID-19 infection during pregnancy was 
significantly associated with AGA outcomes (P = 0.009). No significant 
associations were found between common risk factors (e. g. hypertension, 
diabetes mellitus) and foetal growth restriction. Congenital CMV infection was 
not significantly associated with SGA. Logistic regression analysis confirmed 
the association of COVID-19 infection with foetal weight, while no significant 
effect was observed for CMV.
CONCLUSION: Maternal COVID-19 infection was associated with AGA outcomes, 
potentially due to enhanced medical surveillance and immune responses. However, 
the study's small sample size limits the interpretation of these findings, and 
further research is required to fully understand the impacts of COVID-19 on 
pregnancy. No significant association between congenital CMV infection and 
foetal growth restriction was found in this cohort, which was most likely due to 
the low prevalence of cCMV. Moreover, documented risk factors for foetal growth 
restriction, including hypertension and diabetes mellitus, were not 
statistically significant in our study population.

There is growing evidence for direct actions of follicle-stimulating hormone 
(FSH) on tissues other than the ovaries and testes. Blocking FSH action, either 
genetically or pharmacologically, protects against bone loss, fat gain, and 
memory loss in mice. We thus developed a humanized FSH-blocking 
antibody--MS-Hu6--as a lead therapeutic for three diseases of public health 
magnitude--osteoporosis, obesity and Alzheimer's disease (AD) that track 
together in post-menopausal women. Here, we report the crystal structure of 
MS-Hu6 and its interaction with FSH in atomistic detail. Using our 
Good-Laboratory-Practice-Compliant platform (21CFR58), we formulated MS-Hu6 and 
the murine equivalent Hf2 at an ultra-high concentration; both formulated 
antibodies displayed enhanced thermal and colloidal stability. A single 
injection of 89Zr-labelled MS-Hu6 revealed a beta-phase t½ of 89 and 131 hours 
for female and male mice, respectively, with retention in regions of interest. 
Female mice injected subcutaneously with Hf2 displayed a dose-dependent 
reduction in body weight and body fat. Hf2 also rescued recognition memory and 
spatial learning loss in a context- and time-dependent manner in AD-prone 3xTg 
and APP/PS1 mice. MS-Hu6 injected into African green monkeys (8 mg/kg) 
intravenously, and then subcutaneously at monthly intervals, was safe, and 
without effects on vitals, blood chemistries or blood counts. There was a 
notable ~4% weight loss in all four monkeys after the first injection, which 
continued in two of four monkeys. We thus provide IND-enabling data towards an 
upcoming first-in-human study.

BACKGROUND: Although excessive salt intake increases the risk of adverse health 
outcomes, its effects may vary among individuals, supporting the concept of salt 
sensitivity. This study aimed to investigate whether genetic factors, 
represented by the polygenic risk score for hypertension (PRS-hypertension), 
could act as determinants of salt sensitivity and modify the impact of salt 
intake on incident chronic kidney disease (CKD).
METHODS: Data from UK Biobank were used, including participants of White British 
ancestry without preexisting CKD or hypertension. The primary exposures were the 
self-reported frequency of adding salt to food and the PRS-hypertension tertile 
group. The primary outcome was the development of CKD, analyzed using 
multivariable Cox models.
RESULTS: Among 258,555 participants (mean age 55.3 ± 8.1 years, 44% men), 8,686 
(3%) cases of incident CKD were observed during median follow-up of 13.7 years. 
A significant interaction was observed between PRS-hypertension and frequency of 
adding salt with respect to CKD risk (P for multiplicative interaction = 0.001). 
In the high PRS-hypertension group, compared to those who rarely/never added 
salt to food, the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.11 (95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.02 to 1.21) for those who sometimes added salt, and 1.23 (95% CI, 1.14 to 
1.36) for those who usually/always added salt. Additionally, there were 
significant additive interactions between high PRS-hypertension and 
usually/always adding salt on the risk of incident CKD compared with those with 
low PRS-hypertension and who rarely/never added salt (relative excess risk due 
to interaction=0.19; 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.34; attributable proportion=0.15; 95% CI: 
0.04 to 0.27).
CONCLUSION: PRS-hypertension modified the association between frequency of 
adding salt and incident CKD. These findings suggest that the effects of high 
sodium intake on kidney function may be influenced by genetic factors.

BACKGROUND: Important questions remain about how bariatric (i.e. weight loss) 
surgery affects measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) and estimated GFR 
(eGFR) as well as what factors influence change in mGFR post-surgery.
METHODS: Data were pooled from all seven available studies (dates: 2004-2018) 
measuring GFR pre- and post-bariatric surgery using gold standard methods. 
Change in post-surgery mGFR, factors that influence change in mGFR, and effects 
on five GFR-estimating equations were analyzed using standard statistical 
methods.
RESULTS: The cohort included 105 individuals from the US and Europe. 68% were 
female, 97% white, mean age was 50 years (range: 24-70), and mean BMI 46±8 
kg/m2. Mean pre-surgery mGFR of 107 ml/min (range: 31-215) fell to 92 ml/min 
(-14%, 95% CI: -21, -10) post-surgery, with a strong linear relationship 
existing between pre-surgery mGFR and % change in GFR (r=-0.51; -0.64, -0.35). 
Individuals with pre-surgery mGFR ≥90, 60-<90, and <60 ml/min had -25 (-32, 
-19), 1 (-11, 13P=0.82), and 7 (0, 14) ml/min mean postoperative changes in 
mGFR. Change in weight was significantly correlated with change in mGFR (r=0.22; 
0.03, 0.40). After adjusting for sex, changes in mGFR post-surgery were 
associated with higher pre-surgical age (-0.6 ml/min per year; -1.1, -0.2), mGFR 
(-0.5 ml/min per 1 ml/min; -0.6, -0.4) and change in systolic blood pressure 
(-0.3 ml/min per 1 mmHg; -0.6, 0.0). All GFR-estimating equations significantly 
underestimated post-surgical GFR reductions in people with preserved kidney 
function and had improved bias, precision and accuracy when de-indexed and 
applied to individuals with mGFR<90 ml/min.
CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery the 
magnitude of post-surgical decline in mGFR is directly associated with 
pre-surgery GFR and only weakly correlated with weight loss. Additionally, 
GFR-estimating equations' performance improved when de-indexed and used in 
people with reduced kidney function, with the combined creatinine/cystatin C 
equations having the best overall performance.

OBJECTIVE: Most health research on coal miners has focused primarily on 
cardio-respiratory health and injuries, despite the presence of significant risk 
factors for poor mental health in the industry, including illness and pain, 
traumatic experiences, and socio-economic stressors.
METHODS: Clinical and occupational data from coal miners examined in a West 
Virginia clinic between 2004-2015 was used to examine associations between 
physical indicators of health and antidepressant/anxiolytic medication use 
(proxy for depression/anxiety) through multivariable models.
RESULTS: Antidepressant/anxiolytic use was prevalent (33%) in this population. 
Lung function impairment, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic pain, 
and trauma significantly increased the odds of antidepressant/anxiolytic 
medication use.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals a high burden of depression and/or anxiety among 
U.S. coal miners and underscores the importance of evaluating this workforce for 
their mental health, which has largely been ignored to date.

IN BRIEF: Preeclampsia is a severe pregnancy-related complication that can 
result in adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Current therapeutic options for 
preeclampsia remain limited. This study demonstrates that epicatechin can 
inhibit pyroptosis in extravillous trophoblasts and block the activation of the 
NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby offering a novel therapeutic approach for the 
management of preeclampsia.
ABSTRACT: Preeclampsia (PE) is characterized as new-onset hypertension and 
proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation, and affects 5%-7% pregnant women 
globally. PE is associated with a systemic inflammatory status that is overly 
activated and contributes to dysregulated extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) 
invasion and impaired spiral vessel remodeling. Recent studies showed that 
inhibition of systematic inflammatory response significantly ameliorates the 
PE-like symptoms, suggesting that anti-inflammation could be a potential PE 
treatment. However, few effective therapeutic strategies have been shown to 
control systemic inflammation in PE patients. In the current study, we 
investigated the protective effects of epicatechin (EC), one small molecule 
compound that exhibits excellent anti-inflammatory activity, on HTR8/SVneo cells 
and EVTs stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our results revealed that EC 
pretreatment significantly improved cellular viability and attenuated the 
inflammatory response of EVTs in response to LPS stimulation. Mechanistically, 
we found that EC significantly blocked the activation of the LPS-induced 
pyroptosis pathway of classical pyrin domain protein 3, cleaved caspase 1 and 
cleaved gasdermin D (NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD) in LPS-treated EVTs and inhibited 
interleukin-1β (IL-1β) expression (a hallmark of pyroptosis) by suppressing the 
nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling. Our study demonstrates the protective 
effects of EC on LPS-stimulated and provide the direct evidence in vitro that EC 
may be a promising compound that mitigates the PE-associated systemic 
inflammation.

We aimed to explore the metabolic dysregulations and diagnostic biomarkers for 
post-traumatic deep venous thrombosis (pt-DVT) in hypertensive (HPT) patients 
after fracture. An untargeted ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry-based metabolomics approach was employed to perform a comprehensive 
metabolic analysis of plasma samples of 80 patients with post-traumatic deep 
venous thrombosis and hypertension (pt-DVT&HPT) and 117 patients with 
hypertension only (HPT). Thirty-seven (37) differential metabolites were 
identified between pt-DVT&HPT and HPT patients. Purine metabolism, citric acid 
cycle, sphingolipid metabolism, histidine metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA 
biosynthesis, valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation were the most 
significantly altered metabolic pathways in pt-DVT in HPT patients. 
Metabolite-protein interaction network analysis unveils ten (10) proteins/genes 
that could serve as therapeutic targets. Multivariate methods with Unbiased 
Variable selection in the R package (MUVR) algorithm identified four metabolites 
as novel biomarkers for pt-DVT&HPT, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) 
analysis showed that a predictive model based on the four biomarkers 
(l-carnitine, lactic acid, adenine, and l-acetylcarnitine) exhibited better 
predictive capability for pt-DVT than the D-Dimer. The integration of these 
diagnostic biomarkers and D-Dimer increased its diagnostic potential. The 
generalization ability of this biomarker panel was validated in an independent 
cohort. This study contributed to our understanding of metabolic alterations 
associated with pt-DVT and paved the way for early diagnosis of pt-DVT in HPT 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) represents a pathological response 
to endothelial damage, caused by genetic or acquired factors. It includes 
conditions like thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, atypical hemolytic uremic 
syndrome (aHUS), and secondary TMAs. Malignant hypertension can both result from 
and trigger TMA. This study aims to identify risk factors for severe cardiac 
involvement, defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 50%, in patients 
with concomitant TMA and malignant hypertension, and to investigate the 
evolution of cardiac anomalies post-TMA remission.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected data of 33 patients with TMA and malignant 
hypertension, admitted to our hospital between January 2014 and December 2023. 
Patients were followed up to monitor kidney function, blood pressure, and 
hematological parameters, and those with severe cardiac involvement at admission 
underwent repeated echocardiograms. Genetic testing for complement factors was 
performed to identify aHUS cases.
RESULTS: Severe cardiac involvement was diagnosed in 9 patients, all of whom 
exhibited left ventricular hypertrophy and varying degrees of diastolic 
dysfunction and valve regurgitation. Patients with severe cardiac involvement 
had significantly higher interventricular septal and posterior wall thickness at 
admission. Over a mean follow up of 42 months, all patients with severe cardiac 
involvement showed recovery of left ventricular systolic function. Patients with 
severe cardiac involvement had a higher incidence of respiratory failure [5/9 
(56%) vs 2/24 (8%) patients, p = 0.003] and kidney failure [7/9 (78%) vs 8/24 
(33%) patients, p = 0.022].
CONCLUSIONS: Severe cardiac involvement in TMA associated with malignant 
hypertension is common but largely reversible. Early identification and tailored 
treatment can lead to improved outcomes. This study highlights the importance of 
comprehensive cardiac assessment in managing TMA patients with malignant 
hypertension.

INTRODUCTION: Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] has been linked to myocardial fibrosis and 
endothelial dysfunction, proposed mechanisms for diastolic dysfunction (DD). 
This study assessed the association between elevated Lp(a) (≥ 50 mg/dL) and DD 
in patients with preserved ejection fraction (EF).
AIM: We analyzed 1492 adults (median age59) with an Lp(a) measurement and 
echocardiogram (1997-2024).
METHODS: Diastolicdysfunction required ≥ 3 abnormal echo parameters, as per 
recent guidelines. Logisticregression adjusting for potential confounders was 
performed.
RESULTS: Seventy-sevenpatients (5.1%) had DD. Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL was not 
associated with DD [adjusted oddsratio (aOR): 0.89, 95% confidence interval 
(CI): 0.49-1.54]. However, age (aOR:1.03, p = 0.026), hypertension (aOR: 1.83, p 
= 0.042), diabetes mellitus (aOR: 2.43, p =0.002), and cardiovascular (CV) 
diseases (aOR: 1.90, p = 0.043) were associated withDD, while statin therapy was 
associated with reduced risk (aOR: 0.51, p = 0.016).
CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of preserved EF, Lp(a) was not associated with 
DD,emphasizing management of traditional CV risks.

INTRODUCTION: The teach-back method is an effective strategy for enhancing 
patient engagement in chronic disease management. However, no studies have 
explored the impact of combining this educational approach with wearable devices 
on patient engagement in hypertension management.
AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a teach-back-based 
educational approach in promoting engagement with wearable devices among 
patients with hypertension.
METHODS: A longitudinal study was conducted. The study included 76 patients and 
included three phases. In the first phase (T0), patients received training about 
the use of two wearable technology devices through the teach-back method. 
Immediately afterward, participants completed the TWente Engagement with 
E-health Technologies Scale (TWEETS) to measure engagement at T0. Patient 
engagement was reassessed at 6 (T1) and 12 weeks (T2) after the educational 
training. A repeated-measures ANOVA was performed to compare the mean scores 
across the three phases.
RESULTS: The statistical analysis revealed no significant change in the TWEETS 
score between T0 and T1 (p = 0.42). However, the score significantly decreased 
at T2 compared to the previous two time points (p < 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the teach-back method is effective for 
maintaining patient engagement in the short to medium term. However, its impact 
appears to decrease over time. Nurses can use the teach-back method to support 
education and enhance engagement with digital technology among hypertensive 
patients. Further research is needed to explore whether combining teach-back 
with additional strategies, such as gamification, telemedicine, remote 
monitoring, or peer support, can help sustain long-term patient engagement with 
digital health technologies.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a growing global health concern, 
and diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) affects up to 12% of individuals with 
diabetes, leading to myocardial hypertrophy, ventricular remodeling, and 
contractile dysfunction, ultimately progressing to heart failure (HF). This 
review explores the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in DCM development and their 
potential as diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers.
RECENT FINDINGS: MicroRNAs, short single-stranded non-coding RNAs, are key 
regulators of various pathophysiological processes in DCM. By modulating gene 
expression, they influence critical signaling pathways involved in inflammation, 
apoptosis, pyroptosis, oxidative stress, and fibrosis, all of which contribute 
to DCM progression. Emerging research suggests that miRNAs could serve as 
early-stage biomarkers for asymptomatic DCM and may offer novel therapeutic 
targets. This systematic review compiles current findings from both animal and 
human studies on the role of miRNAs in DCM. It highlights their potential in the 
early diagnosis and treatment of DCM, underscoring the need for further research 
to translate these insights into clinical applications.

Outcomes following the arterial switch operation (ASO) are well documented. 
Survival and long-term morbidity for fetuses diagnosed with dextro-transposition 
of the great arteries (d-TGA) are less reported. We aimed to document survival, 
reinterventions and morbidity for prenatally diagnosed d-TGA to inform prenatal 
counseling. Fetuses with d-TGA with or without ventricular septal defect (VSD) 
diagnosed between 1995 and 2022 at our institution were reviewed. Outcomes were 
compared to postnatally diagnosed patients undergoing intervention during the 
same era. Two hundred and seven fetuses were diagnosed resulting in 201 
livebirths, 2 intrauterine demise, and 4 pregnancy terminations. There were 137 
(68.2%) with isolated d-TGA and 64 (31.8%) with d-TGA-VSD. Median birthweight 
3.21 kg (IQR 2.94-3.5 kg), and median birth gestation 38 weeks (IQR 38-39). 
Preoperative balloon atrial septostomy (BAS) was performed in 126/201(62.7%). No 
patients died prior to BAS. Three died before ASO following BAS. ASO was 
performed in 198/201(98.5%) with 45/198(22.7%) having concomitant VSD closure. 
Thirty-day survival for ASO was 95.5%. Survival over the study period was 
186/201(92.5%). During the same period, 91 infants were referred for surgery 
with postnatal diagnosis, and 90 underwent ASO. There was no significant 
difference in 30-day or long-term survival following ASO according to timing of 
diagnosis. Three prenatally diagnosed patients undergoing the ASO were lost to 
follow up. There was no significant difference in reintervention rates 
(prenatal: 18/195 (9.2%); postnatal: 12/86 (13.9%) p = 0.24). Morbidity in 
prenatally diagnosed patients included myocardial dysfunction 3/195(1.5%), 
pulmonary hypertension 1/195(0.5%), supraventricular tachycardia 3/195(1.5%), 
neurological morbidity 9/195(4.6%), and autism 11/195(5.6%), and none were 
statistically different to the postnatal group. Survival following prenatal 
diagnosis of d-TGA is good. In the prenatally diagnosed cohort there were no 
deaths prior to BAS. Three died after BAS, with one of these deaths attributable 
to newborn hypoxia between BAS and ASO. Following ASO, most patients survive 
into third decade following prenatal diagnosis. Reintervention occurred in 9.2%. 
Neurological and behavioral morbidity affected approximately 1 in 20 patients. 
Outcomes for those with prenatal diagnosis of d-TGA are comparable with the 
patients that undergo ASO following postnatal diagnosis, but this excludes 
patients with a postnatal diangosis who did not survive to cardiac intervention. 
This data will be helpful for prenatal counseling.

Background The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted healthcare utilization and, 
consequently, real-world data. In this study, we used analytical and data 
visualization approaches to untangle effects on condition measurement and true 
shifts in the patient population seeking healthcare. Methods We used MerativeTM 
MarketScan® 2018-2020 commercial claims data to develop 24 monthly cohorts of 
patients aged ≥18 years with 12 months baseline enrollment and an encounter for 
diabetes, cancer, hypertension, depression, myocardial infarction (MI), atrial 
fibrillation (Afib), or urinary tract infections (UTI) as the index condition in 
a given month. We compared monthly prevalence of each condition in 2020 vs. 
2019. We then imposed 3, 6, and 12-month look-back periods (LBP) to capture 
comorbidities grouped by Clinical Classifications Software Refined (CCSR) or 
summarized in the Charleson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and conducted similar 2020 
versus 2019 prevalence comparisons. Results Changes in condition prevalence 
varied across conditions with strongest declines for cancer in April 2020 
(-57.4%) and strongest increases for depression in December 2020 (+11.8%). The 
mean CCI was higher for most conditions during the spring of 2020 and this 
difference was accentuated by applying a longer LBP. Similar trends were found 
regarding the number of CCSR categories. Conclusion Pandemic-related changes in 
condition capture were complex, involving both increases and decreases in 
encounters for specific conditions and in comorbidities, along with variations 
in comorbidity capture dependent on look-back periods. We provided a practical 
approach to untangle these phenomena along with open-source algorithms and 
visualization tools to assess these changes and inform study design and 
analysis.

OBJECTIVE: To assess heterologous booster (HB) with Janssen Ad26.COV2.S in 
kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with low antibody levels after multiple 
COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicenter study examined anti-spike protein 
antibody levels in KTRs with two or more doses of mRNA vaccinations. Enrollment 
was from April 11, 2022, to September 19, 2023. Kidney transplant recipients 
with low levels (LL, 0.4-250 IU/mL) were offered HB with Janssen Ad26.COV2.S 
vaccine. Those with undetectable levels (UL, <0.4 IU/mL) were randomized to HB 
with or without immunosuppression adjustment. The primary endpoint was 
anti-spike protein antibody levels greater than 250 IU/mL (high level [HL]) at 
28 days after HB. Subset analysis included lymphocyte, immunoglobulin, and 
COVID-19-specific T- and B-cell levels.
RESULTS: Of the 419 unique KTRs assessed, 80.0% (n=335) were HL, 12.9% (n=54) 
were LL, and 7.2% (n=30) were UL. All KTRs vaccinated pretransplantation had 
detectable levels. Twenty-eight days after HB, 62.9% (n=22 of 35) of patients 
with LL achieved HL. Although 9 of 20 (45%) patients with UL achieved LL, none 
achieved HL by 28 days despite mycophenolate mofetil cessation before HB. 
Undetectable level was associated with fewer T and B cells in many subsets and 
fewer COVID-19-specific memory B cells.
CONCLUSION: Most KTRs had HL anti-spike protein antibodies after two or more 
mRNA vaccinations due to vaccinations with or without prior infection. Many LL 
patients responded to HB. No UL reached HL; likely due to severely impaired 
immune system. In this KTR population, a potential durable antibody response was 
identified if vaccinated before transplantation. Ultimately, monitoring antibody 
levels after vaccination might identify patients who could benefit from 
alternative prophylaxis strategies.

Preeclampsia (PE) is a severe hypertensive disorder that occurs during 
pregnancy. Exposure to particulate matter (PM), particularly fine particles such 
as PM2.5/PM10, has been investigated as a potential environmental risk factor 
for its development. In this study, we employed both meta-analysis and Mendelian 
randomization (MR) to investigate the relationship between PM exposure and PE 
risk. The meta-analysis of 26 studies (>2 million pregnancies) found modest 
associations between PM exposure and PE risk. In particular, PM2.5 exposure 
during the second trimester (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01-1.04) and PM10 exposure (OR 
= 1.06, 95% CI: 1.00-1.12) showed significant associations. Subgroup and 
meta-regression analyses revealed that regional differences, particularly 
between Europe and Asia, were major contributors to heterogeneity, while 
publication year showed minimal impact. In contrast, no significant associations 
were found for PM exposure during the first and third trimesters, with greater 
statistical uncertainty likely due to heterogeneity in study design and exposure 
assessment methods. The MR analysis, using genetic instruments from European 
genome-wide association studies data, did not support a causal relationship 
between PM exposure and PE risk (PM2.5: OR = 1.128, 95% CI: -0.593- 0.834; PM10: 
OR = 0.668, 95% CI: -1.482-0.675). These findings suggest that while PM 
exposure, particularly during mid-pregnancy, may be associated with increased PE 
risk in observational studies, the lack of a confirmed causal link in MR 
analysis indicates potential influence from residual confounding, exposure 
misclassification, and study heterogeneity. Therefore, the observed associations 
should be interpreted with caution.

The hemoglobin glycation index (HGI) has emerged as a pivotal biomarker for 
evaluating long-term glycemic control, offering a more comprehensive assessment 
compared with conventional glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurements. Elevated 
HGI levels are significantly correlated with the incidence of cardiometabolic 
diseases (CMDs). This review synthesizes current evidence on the clinical 
utility of the HGI across coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, heart 
failure (HF), diabetes mellitus (DM), serum uric acid (SUA) levels, and 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), thereby providing clinicians with an 
enhanced framework for precise disease stratification, therapeutic optimization, 
and prognostic prediction.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify risk factors for physical frailty 
incidence among people with HIV (PWH) and HIV-negative individuals and further 
explore the dynamic relationship between major chronic diseases and frailty.
METHODS: PWH and HIV-negative individuals aged ≥40 years from the Comparative 
HIV and Aging Research in Taizhou (CHART) cohort were included. Univariate and 
multivariate Cox regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) 
and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the association between risk factors and 
physical frailty.
RESULTS: A total of 3,968 participants (1,279 cases and 2,689 controls) were 
included. Regardless of HIV status, the overall trend of physical frailty 
incidence density increased with age, and aging significantly elevated the risk 
of frailty. Central obesity (aHR=2.15, 95% CI: 1.09-4.23), hypertension 
(aHR=2.06, 95% CI: 1.03-4.11) and current unsuppressed HIV viral load (aHR=2.20, 
95% CI: 1.01-4.80) increased the risk of frailty incident among PWH, while 
depression (aHR=1.93, 95% CI: 1.06-3.50) and diabetes (aHR=1.85, 95% CI: 
1.18-2.90) increased the risk of frailty among HIV-negative controls. Dynamic 
Change analyses showed that incident depression, incident neurocognitive 
impairment, and persistent hypertension during a 3.18-year follow-up were 
associated with a higher risk of frailty among PWH. In contrast, incident 
depression, persistent depression, and persistent diabetes were significantly 
associated with frailty incidence among HIV-negative controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Aging was significantly associated with a higher risk of physical 
frailty regardless of HIV status. Risk factors and the association between 
dynamic changes in major chronic diseases and frailty were different between 
HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals.

Cardiovascular toxicity associated with sedative drug use: Post-market 
pharmacovigilance study with disproportionality analysis.

Ye P, Zhang H, Lyu Q, Zhang W, Xu Y, Ye X, Guo X.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the toxicity of sedatives in critically ill intensive care 
unit patients and investigate safety concerns using the United States Food and 
Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System and VigiBase databases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Disproportionality analysis was used to assess the 
relationships among midazolam, propofol, and dexmedetomidine and suspected 
adverse drug reactions. Adverse drug reactions related to sedation in the 
intensive care unit were identified through systematic organ classification and 
assessed using Standardized Regulatory Activities Medical Dictionary Analysis 
Queries.
RESULTS: A total of 12,102 adverse drug reactions were identified with 
midazolam, propofol, or dexmedetomidine as the primary suspected drug. The 
cardiovascular system accounted for a significant proportion of the drug 
reaction systems with strong signals. The strongest preferred term was neonatal 
hypertension (N = 9; information component = 7.11 (95% confidence interval: 
5.97 - 7.87)), propofol infusion syndrome (N = 482; information 
component = 10.88 (95% confidence interval: 10.73 - 10.99)), and the 
trigemino-cardiac reflex (N = 7; information component = 10.36 (95% confidence 
interval: 9.06 - 11.21)) for midazolam, propofol, and dexmedetomidine, 
respectively. The Standardized Regulatory Activities Medical Dictionary Analysis 
Queries with the strongest signal across all sedatives were torsade de pointes 
and shock-associated conditions (N = 679; information component = 4.24 (95% 
confidence interval: 4.12 - 4.34)).
CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the need for clinicians to consider 
cardiovascular toxicity when administering sedatives in the intensive care unit, 
as different sedatives exhibit different adverse reaction profiles.

BACKGROUND: Glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) derived from serum creatinine 
(eGFRcr), cystatin C (eGFRcys), or both (eGFRcr-cys) by race-free equations are 
recommended staging chronic kidney disease (CKD). The current study aimed to 
compare these race-free eGFR equations for screening for low-grade CKD in Blacks 
and non-Blacks and to evaluate their association with mortality.
METHODS: Race-free eGFR equations were evaluated in four studies with specific 
inclusion criteria based on the original research goals: African-PREDICT 
(341/380 healthy Black/White South Africans), FLEMENGHO (709 White 
community-dwelling Flemish), NHANES (1760/7931 Black and non-Black adult 
Americans), and 401 Black African patients hospitalised in Mbuji Mayi, 
Democratic Republic of Congo. The intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland 
and Altman statistics were used to assess consistency between eGFR equations and 
multivariable logistic or Cox regression to evaluate their association with 
mortality.
RESULTS: Intraindividual discordance between eGFRs was larger in Black than 
non-Black NHANES and African-PREDICT participants. In NHANES, eGFRcr-cys was 
greater than eGFRcr, but smaller than eGFRcys, and replacing eGFRcr-cys by 
eGFRcr moved 25% Blacks and 15% non-Blacks to a higher (worse) eGFR KDIGO stage. 
In African-PREDICT and FLEMENGO, half of the measured creatinine clearance to 
eGFR ratios fell outside the expected 1.1-1.2 band. In NHANES, multivariable 
hazard ratios for total and cardiovascular mortality in relation to CKD grade 
were all lower than unity for grade-1 CKD and greater than unity for grade ≥3 
(p < 0.0001) without any racial difference (0.11 ≤ p ≤ 0.98). These NHANES 
findings were consistent, if CKD stage was replaced by eGFR and in subgroup 
analyses. Whereas eGFRcys and eGFRcr-cys refined models, eGFRcr did not.
CONCLUSIONS: The NHANES mortality outcomes support the use of eGFRcys and 
eGFRcr-cys. However, large intraindividual variability between eGFR estimates 
may lead to KDIGO eGFR stage misclassification and calls for caution in the 
opportunistic or systematic screening for CKD in asymptomatic individuals with 
prevention as objective.

Plain Language Summary: Glomerular filtration rate reflects the ability to 
remove excess water and waste by the kidney and can be estimated from serum 
creatinine (eGFR). However, serum creatinine is affected by muscle mass, dietary 
habits and other factors that cluster by race and lead to overestimation of eGFR 
and underestimation of the risk of kidney disease in Black individuals. Serum 
cystatin C is less affected by these confounders. Equations to compute eGFR from 
serum cystatin C or both serum creatinine and cystatin C without considering 
race are currently recommended. This study evaluated these race-free equations 
to compute eGFR in multi-ethnic study populations recruited in South Africa, 
Belgium, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United States. The new 
methods produce eGFR estimates, which predict mortality and have near perfect 
reproducibility in the population as a whole. However, this study also 
identified large intraindividual differences between eGFR estimates that may 
lead to misclassification of patients with regard to their renal function. These 
observations call for caution in the clinical application of equations to derive 
eGFR from serum markers and highlight the need for further research to optimise 
the prevention and management of chronic kidney disease.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the utility of the Odds Ratio Product (ORP) in 
differentiating comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA) from obstructive 
sleep apnea (OSA) and chronic insomnia (CIN).
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 9750 patients in four groups: 1) 1152 
controls; 2) 2395 with CIN; 3) 2297 with OSA; and 4) 3906 with COMISA. CIN was 
defined as difficulty initiating/maintaining sleep with daytime 
fatigue/sleepiness occurring "often"/"always". OSA was defined as an 
apnea-hypopnea index >5 on polysomnography. ORP, computed every 3 seconds from 
polysomnography, was analyzed alongside sleep metrics, comorbidities, and sleep 
habits. Associations were assessed using univariate multinomial logistic 
regression, followed by stepwise regression to identify independent predictors 
of COMISA versus OSA or CIN. Machine learning models classified COMISA, OSA, and 
CIN as distinct clinical groups.
RESULTS: ORP-derived features showed stronger associations with COMISA than 
traditional sleep metrics (except N3 latency). Independent objective predictors 
of COMISA included male sex (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = [1.16, 1.47]), BMI (1.27, 
[1.25, 1.29]), N3 latency (1.21, [1.13, 1.29]), age (1.17, [1.16, 1.19]), peak 
ORP during spontaneous arousals (1.12, [1.01, 1.25]), and time in ORP decile 7 
(1.10, [1.07, 1.13]). Subjective predictors included depression, hypertension, 
allergy, headache, sleep aid/alcohol use, sleepiness, and lower sleep duration. 
Machine learning achieved overall accuracy of 61.2% (p<.05), with sensitivity of 
71% for COMISA, 65% for OSA, and 43% for CIN.
CONCLUSIONS: ORP is a promising objective marker for COMISA, distinguishing it 
from OSA more effectively than sleep metrics but separating COMISA from CIN 
poorly.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a hereditary disorder 
leading to kidney cyst formation and loss of kidney function. The major 
causative genes Pkd1 and Pkd2 encode for the ciliary proteins Polycystin-1 (PC1) 
and Polycystin-2 (PC2), respectively, which are involved in ciliary functions. 
Within PKD1-defective cells, the accumulation of misfolded PC1 proteins triggers 
the unfolded protein response (UPR). Among the pathways activated, the 
ER-associated degradation (ERAD), mediated by proteins such as 
valosin-containing protein (VCP), aims to alleviate the unfolded or misfolded 
protein burden. Our study investigates the genetic relationship between VCP and 
PC1-dependent cystogenesis. We found that the pharmacological inhibition of VCP 
ameliorates the cystic phenotype in Pkd1-knockout mice. This effect is 
associated with increased ER stress-dependent apoptosis in PC1-deficient cells. 
Additionally, we discovered that VCP is localized in the primary cilia and its 
inhibition affects cilia assembly and reduces the cilia length.

Current triplet regimens associating therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), 
immunosuppression with corticosteroids and rituximab, and caplacizumab have 
dramatically improved the outcome of immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic 
purpura (iTTP). However, nearly half of the patients require extended 
caplacizumab treatment (i.e., > 30 days) due to persistent ADAMTS13 deficiency, 
raising cost and tolerance concerns. Therefore, we investigated whether 
anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies titer and their trajectory during the acute phase of 
the disease could predict ADAMTS13 improvement (i.e., activity ≥ 20% before 
day-30 post-TPE). From a cohort of 286 patients receiving the triplet regimen, 
we identified on diagnosis a cut-off value for anti-ADAMTS13 IgG antibodies of 
90.5 U/mL, with a modest discriminating ability (AUC: 0.57) for predicting 
long-term response, precluding its use to guide therapeutic strategies. 
Nonetheless, the analysis of anti-ADAMTS13 IgG antibodies titer trajectory from 
diagnosis revealed that the proportion of iTTP patients with ADAMTS13 activity 
improvement was higher in patients who decreased (Dec+) their antibodies titer 
within the 7-14 days interval post-TPE compared to those without decrease (Dec-) 
(65% vs. 25% of cases, respectively, p < 0.001), a finding confirmed in a 
validation cohort (N = 51). These results highlight the possibility of 
intensifying immunosuppression in an early period post-TPE to shorten time to 
ADAMTS13 activity recovery. Close monitoring of anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies titer 
may guide immunomodulation strategies, including additional courses of B-cell 
depleting agents when appropriate.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have shown great potential in 
improving cardiovascular pharmacotherapy by optimizing drug selection, 
predicting therapeutic efficacy and adverse effects, ultimately improving 
patient outcomes. Leveraging techniques like machine learning and in silico 
modelling, AI can identify populations likely to benefit from specific 
treatments, expedite novel drug discovery and reduce costs. Computational 
methods can also facilitate the detection of drug interactions and tailor 
interventions based on real-world data, supporting personalized care. Artificial 
intelligence-based approaches also show promise in streamlining clinical trial 
design and execution, leveraging on real-time data on patient responsiveness, 
enhancing recruitment efficiency. However, in order to fully realize these 
benefits, robust validation across diverse patient populations is necessary to 
ensure accuracy and generalizability. In addition, addressing concerns regarding 
data quality, privacy, and bias is equally critical to avoid exacerbating 
existing healthcare disparities. Scientific societies and regulatory agencies 
must ultimately establish standardized frameworks for data management, model 
certification, and transparency, to enable safe and effective integration of AI 
into clinical practice. This manuscript aims at systematically reviewing the 
current state-of-the-art applications of AI in cardiovascular pharmacotherapy, 
describing their current potential in guiding treatment decisions, refine trial 
methodologies and support drug discovery.

AIMS: Cardiovascular risk increases progressively increases from lower blood 
pressure (BP) values in females than males, questioning current universal 
thresholds for hypertension. In this study, we established female- and 
age-specific thresholds for hypertension and assessed its association with 
subclinical cardiac aberrations in a high-risk female group of women after 
preeclampsia.
METHODS: A standardized cross-sectional cardiovascular assessment was performed 
among former pregnant women, including 30-minutes BP measurement and 
transthoracic echocardiography to assess cardiac function and remodelling. Women 
with a history of normotensive pregnancy constituted the cardiovascular healthy 
reference group, in whom we established thresholds for elevated BP (≥95th 
percentile). The risk for subclinical cardiac aberrations in case of elevated BP 
was evaluated among former preeclamptic women.
RESULTS: A number of 463 women were included in the healthy reference group and 
951 formerly preeclamptic women (43±8 and 39±8 years, respectively). 
Female-specific thresholds defining hypertension were 132.8 mmHg systolic or 
81.0 mmHg diastolic. Among former preeclamptic women, systolic BP levels above 
≥132.8 mmHg but below current diagnostic threshold for hypertension (<140 mmHg) 
significantly associated with increased odds for left ventricular concentric 
remodelling (OR= 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-4.2), diastolic dysfunction (OR = 4.5 
(1.4-14.2)), and subclinical heart failure (OR= 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.2).
CONCLUSION: For relatively young women, female-specific thresholds for 
hypertension are lower than ESC/ESH guidelines (≥133/81 versus ≥140/90 mmHg), 
and associate with cardiac dysfunction in formerly preeclamptic women. Sex- and 
age-tailored interpretation of BP improves prevention of heart failure 
development and progression among high-risk women.

Plain Language Summary: In women, sex- and age-guided interpretation of blood 
pressure will enhance timely detection of increased cardiovascular risks, and 
improve personalized prevention of cardiovascular disease development and 
progression. Female-specific reference values for hypertension are ≥133/81 mmHg, 
and thereby lower than the current ESC/ESH guidelines state (≥140/90 
mmHg).Levels in-between these distinct thresholds relate to subclinical cardiac 
abnormalities in high-risk women, amongst left ventricular hypertrophy, left 
ventricular concentric remodeling, diastolic dysfunction and heart failure stage 
B among former preeclamptic women at preterm high-risk.

Medical Center, Hershey, Pennsylvania, USA.

BACKGROUND: Utilization of heart failure (HF) guideline-directed medical therapy 
(GDMT) to target doses is suboptimal, with studies citing adverse effects (AEs), 
physiological factors, and therapeutic inertia as potential contributing 
factors. The objective of our study was to explore tolerability and GDMT 
titration-limiting AEs in a specialized heart failure optimization program 
implemented at our institution.
METHODS: We studied the baseline characteristics of 254 patients who 
successfully completed our program and analyzed the frequency and severity of 
the four most common GDMT-related AEs: hypotension, bradycardia, hyperkalemia, 
and renal dysfunction.
RESULTS: Patients who achieved target doses were younger, more likely to have 
nonischemic HF, less likely to have a recent HF-related hospitalization, had 
less coronary artery disease, and were more likely to be obese. Multivariate 
analyses revealed significant associations between beta blocker suboptimal 
dosing (< 50% of target dose) and older age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.04; 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 1.0-1.07; p = 0.031), presence of atrial fibrillation 
(OR: 2.57; 95% CI: 1.18-5.58; p = 0.017), and absence of hypertension (OR: 0.39; 
95% CI: 0.17-0.89; p = 0.025). For angiotensin converting enzyme 
inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers/angiotensin receptor neprilysin 
inhibitors, suboptimal dosing was associated with the presence of atrial 
fibrillation (OR: 2.08; 95% CI: 1.04-4.17; p = 0.039). Of the patients who 
completed the program, 59.1% encountered at least one AE that hindered the 
titration to target GDMT doses.
CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the complexities of GDMT optimization within 
a specialized program and the need for standardized definitions of GDMT-related 
AEs and management strategies.

Obesity remains a critical global health issue with profound medical and 
economic implications. While injectable medications such as semaglutide 
(Wegovy®) and tirzepatide (Zepbound®) have demonstrated significant efficacy, 
the development of novel oral anti-obesity agents presents additional 
therapeutic potential. This narrative review examines recent advances in oral 
pharmacotherapy for obesity, focusing on mechanisms of action, clinical 
effectiveness, anticipated benefits and side effects. A systematic search of 
PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar and ClinicalTrials.gov identified 
relevant studies published between January 2023 and June 2025, including 
randomized controlled trials and clinical investigations of emerging oral 
agents. We have selected emerging oral compounds, currently undergoing clinical 
evaluation but not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These 
include oral GLP-1 RAs, peptides and small molecules, and non-incretin-based 
therapies targeting the melanocortin-4 receptor and the endocannabinoid system, 
among others. Several agents have demonstrated promising efficacy, achieving 
weight loss of ≥10% in clinical trials while also exhibiting favourable safety 
profiles. Emerging oral therapies could complement or serve as alternatives to 
approved injectable treatments, particularly for long-term weight management. 
They may enhance patient access, adherence and satisfaction, thereby broadening 
the scope of pharmacological interventions in obesity care. Ongoing research is 
crucial to confirm the long-term safety, effectiveness and clinical role of 
these agents within comprehensive obesity management strategies. By 
contextualizing these developments, this review underscores the growing promise 
of oral pharmacotherapy in addressing the global obesity epidemic.

AIMS: Despite being the most common cardiovascular risk factor, the actual 
burden of hypertension is poorly characterized in Africa. We meta-analyzed the 
most extensive pooled data to determine the overall prevalence of hypertension 
in Africa.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched 
Google Scholar, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science databases to retrieve 
prevalence studies only on hypertension among Africans published between 2002 
and 2023. Furthermore, we meta-analyzed the crude and age-adjusted prevalences 
of hypertension using a random effect model due to the expected high 
heterogeneity, with logit transformation of the original 
proportions.Seventy-eight (out of an initial 779 screened) articles with 
complete data were included, with a total number of hypertension cases of 71,004 
and a denominator population of 286,575, mostly from community-based studies in 
23 countries. The pooled crude prevalence of hypertension was 28⸱5/100 persons 
[95% confidence interval (CI): 25⸱3%-31⸱8%] and a 95% prediction interval of 
7⸱6%-65⸱6%; the pooled prevalence increased with age and was highest among the 
aged ≥75 years: 51⸱4% (95%CI: 42⸱0%-60⸱6%) and remained highest in the Southern 
Africa region overall (34⸱8%) and in the last decade (2013-2023; 44⸱5%). The 
point estimate of the pooled crude prevalence was higher among urban dwellers, 
32⸱9% (95%CI: 26⸱8%-39⸱5%), than rural residents, 26⸱3% (95%CI: 20⸱4%-33⸱3%). In 
a subset of twenty-one articles reporting age stratification consistent with the 
WHO standard population, the pooled age-standardized prevalence was 27⸱2/100 
persons (95%CI: 20⸱9%-33⸱6%).
CONCLUSION: The burden of hypertension remains high, especially in urban areas 
and with increasing age. Frequent screening and treatment are recommended, 
especially in urban areas.

Medical Sciences, University of Campinas, Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil.

BACKGROUND: Factors related to cardiovascular risk and insulin sensitivity seem 
to be related to the increase in the number of thyroid cancer (TC) diagnosis, 
but there is a lack of studies to corroborate these hypotheses.
METHODS: This observational and cross-sectional study evaluated 
ultrasonographic, clinical, cytological and anatomopathological characteristics 
of thyroid nodules (TN) related with factors indicative of cardiovascular risk 
(CVR), serum lipids, and glucose profiles through medical records, and 
interviews during routine medical consultation.
RESULTS: The study included 160 TN patients, 85.53% women, 41.3% with obesity, 
24.18% with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, 63.4% with arterial hypertension, 9.15% 
with previous CVR, 38.16% with dyslipidemia. 38.5% had Papillary TC, 8.5% 
Follicular TC. Regarding cytology categories (Bethesda,B), 34.64% BII, 8.5% 
BIII, 11.11% BIV, 26.8% BV, 8.5% BVI. Microcalcifications were associated with 
higher Framingham and ASCVD CVR Scores, fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin. 
BII TN had lower fasting glucose; BIII greater glycated hemoglobin; and BIV 
higher both CVR scores. Framingham Score was lower in papillary TC, abdominal 
waist was lower in follicular TC. Higher FT4 increased 4.7 times the chance of 
malignant cytology. Higher HDL was an associated factor for malignant cytology 
(OR = 1.064) and higher FT4 for Differentiated TC (OR = 7.409).
CONCLUSION: TN with greater malignant potential on ultrasound and cytology were 
associated with greater CVR and altered glucose metabolism. Larger goiters and 
multiple nodules were related to factors indicative of insulin resistance. 
Malignant cytology was related to hormonal factors that induce greater cell 
replication, such as thyroxine and insulin resistance.

BACKGROUND: Inflammation, chronic pain, and hypertension have been identified as 
risk factors for cognitive decline; few studies have examined the interplay 
between multiple risk factors and even fewer have considered these factors in 
underserved rural populations.
OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed the relationships between inflammation, chronic 
pain, and hypertension with cognitive functioning in an underserved, primarily 
Hispanic, rural population from Project FRONTIER (Facing Rural Obstacles to 
Healthcare Now Through Intervention, Education, & Research).
METHODS: This epidemiological study enrolled 1,864 participants 
(Mage = 59.68 years, SDage = 12.21) living in five rural counties in West Texas. 
Consented participants disclosed medical diagnoses (e.g. chronic pain), 
completed five cognitive evaluations (i.e. the Repeatable Battery for the 
Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, the Trails Making Test A and B, and 
Clock Drawing 1 and 2), and attended a medical examination during which a 
physician confirmed existing medical conditions (e.g. hypertension) and 
collected a blood sample for further analysis (e.g. inflammation markers).
RESULTS: Analysis via MANOVA revealed a multivariate effect of inflammation 
(V = .02, F(4, 969) = 3.72, p = .006) and a multivariate effect of hypertension 
(V = .03, F(4, 969) = 6.69, p < .001). There was no multivariate effect for 
chronic pain (V = .01, F(4,969) = 2.18, p = .07) and no significant two way or 
three way interaction. Post-hoc ANOVAs further illustrated the relationships 
between specific cognitive functioning domains and inflammation or hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study findings suggest that underserved rural 
populations have unique epidemiological experiences that are distinct from prior 
findings in urban populations. Inflammation and hypertension are important 
clinical considerations as risk factors for cognitive decline. Future research 
should explore interventions that support rural-dwelling individuals impacted by 
provider shortages.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of morbidity in 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Non-high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (non-HDL-c) and remnant cholesterol (RC) have emerged as promising 
markers of atherogenic risk, but their comparative predictive performance 
remains uncertain, particularly in resource-limited settings.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the predictive value of non-HDL-c and RC for 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and associated inflammatory 
and metabolic disturbances in T2DM patients.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 154 T2DM patients attending 
the outpatient diabetic clinic at the Effia Nkwanta Regional Hospital, Ghana. 
Non-HDL-c and RC were calculated from fasting lipid profiles. The TyG index was 
used as a surrogate for insulin resistance. ASCVD risk was assessed using the 
Framingham risk score. Logistic regression and ROC analysis were performed to 
assess predictive utility. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on BMI, 
hypertension, and TyG index.
RESULTS: Non-HDL-C was significantly associated with higher ASCVD risk and 
elevated hs-CRP and resistin levels, while RC showed weaker, non-significant 
associations. Non-HDL-c had a higher AUC (0.78 vs. 0.62), sensitivity, and 
specificity. Nearly half of participants (49.4%) had elevated TyG index (>8.7). 
Non-HDL-C consistently outperformed RC across subgroups.
CONCLUSION: Non-HDL-c is a stronger and more practical predictor of ASCVD risk 
than RC in T2DM patients, particularly in settings with limited access to 
advanced lipid testing. Its use alongside the TyG index offers a cost-effective 
approach for enhancing cardiovascular risk stratification in diabetes care.

INTRODUCTION: International research has consistently shown that individuals 
with hypertension experience significantly impaired sleep quality, but there is 
a lack of study in this field in Malaysia. This study aimed to assess the 
prevalence and associated factors of poor sleep quality among patients with 
hypertension in a primary care clinic in Malaysia.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among patients with hypertension 
aged 18 years and above in a public health clinic from December 2023 to February 
2024. Systematic random sampling was used to recruit participants. 
Sociodemographic data and relevant information were obtained using the 
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21; and 
STOP-BANG questionnaire. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 
27 was used to conduct multiple logistic regression analysis of the determinants 
of poor sleep quality.
RESULTS: A total of 335 participants were recruited, yielding a 98.2% response 
rate. The mean participant age was 58 years, and 63% were women. The prevalence 
of poor sleep quality was 87.2%. Multiple logistic regression showed that 
anxiety symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 12.279, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 
1.573-95.883, P=0.017), low monthly household income (OR=3.573, 95% CI= 
1.627-7.847, P=0.002), lack of exercise (0R=2.530, 95% CI=1.108-5.775, P=0.028) 
and risk of obstructive sleep apnoea (OR=2.521, 95% CI=1.176-5.402, P=0.017) 
were associated with poor sleep quality.
CONCLUSION: Poor sleep quality is prevalent among patients with hypertension and 
is associated with adverse cardiovascular events. Increased awareness among 
primary care physicians would allow early identification of patients at risk for 
early intervention.

Impact of Maternal and Neonatal Factors on Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone 
Concentrations in Newborns in Eastern Morocco.

University, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Oujda, MAR.

INTRODUCTION: Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is a major preventable cause of 
intellectual disability. Neonatal screening based on thyroid-stimulating hormone 
(TSH) levels enables early detection and intervention. While maternal health 
conditions and exposures during pregnancy are known to affect newborn TSH 
levels, the newborn's own characteristics may also influence these results.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1,119 mothers and their 
newborns in the region of Eastern Morocco. A survey was conducted to collect 
sociodemographic data, anthropometric data, and medical history. For the 
newborns, in addition to a clinical examination, heel prick samples were 
collected on blotting papers, and an immunofluorimetric method was used to 
quantify TSH.
RESULTS: The analysis of maternal factors revealed a highly significant 
association between maternal thyroid dysfunction and TSH concentrations in 
newborns (p < 0.001, OR = 11.365). Drug use during pregnancy was also strongly 
associated (p = 0.014, OR = 3.230), especially anti-thyroid treatment (p < 
0.001, OR = 18.218). Conversely, other factors, such as anthropometric 
indicators and pregnancy-related conditions (hypertension, diabetes), showed no 
statistically significant association. As for neonatal factors, high TSH levels 
were significantly more frequent in preterm infants (p = 0.006, OR = 4.09), 
whereas no significant associations were found with other factors (sex, birth 
weight, or length). Hypotonia and feeding difficulties were more prevalent in 
newborns with elevated TSH but did not reach statistical significance.
CONCLUSION: Both maternal and neonatal factors may influence neonatal TSH 
values, in particular, prematurity. The results also show the direct impact of 
maternal thyroid disorders on the newborn's thyroid function. This explains the 
importance of contextual interpretation of TSH results in neonatal screening, 
but also the importance of screening and treating maternal thyroid dysfunction 
during pregnancy.

Interdisciplinary research has revealed that heart, kidney, liver, and metabolic 
diseases share interlinked pathological mechanisms, including inflammation, 
oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and endothelial health issues. However, 
integrated care for these diseases is challenging due to different symptoms, 
diagnostic rules, and treatment options. The review aims to study the common 
mechanisms behind cardiovascular-renal-hepatic-metabolic syndrome and explore 
ways to coordinate management. When these systems work poorly together, damage 
can form a vicious cycle, increasing hypertension, chronic kidney disease, 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and metabolic syndrome. Changes in medicine, 
daily lifestyle, and drugs can interrupt the pathological cascade. However, 
clinical practice is hindered by patient presentations, lack of teamwork across 
healthcare specialties, and incomplete therapy plans. Gut-organ axis dysfunction 
and inflammation play a significant role in multiple organ diseases, and prompt 
risk assessment and early intervention can prevent heart damage.

Porto-sinusoidal vascular disorder (PSVD) is a rare vascular liver disease 
characterised by alterations in the portal and sinusoidal vasculature in the 
absence of cirrhosis, often associated with immune conditions, haematological 
disorders, or medication exposure. We describe a 69-year-old woman with a 
history of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive invasive 
breast cancer, treated with 15 cycles of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) from 
January to October 2020. From the third cycle, she developed an increase in 
aminotransferase levels to three times the upper limit of normal, which 
normalized after discontinuation of T-DM1 due to cancer progression. Two years 
later, she presented to the emergency department with hepatic encephalopathy, 
lower limb oedema, and signs of portal hypertension. Laboratory tests showed 
thrombocytopenia and a cytocholestatic pattern, and hepatic venous pressure 
gradient confirmed portal hypertension. Liver biopsy revealed histological 
features consistent with PSVD without cirrhosis. A diagnosis of drug-induced 
PSVD was made, likely secondary to T-DM1. The patient was treated with diuretics 
and lactulose, with marked clinical improvement and no further complications 
over one year of follow-up. This case underscores the importance of considering 
PSVD in patients with unexplained liver dysfunction and portal hypertension 
following cancer therapy.

AIM: The clinical and prognostic role of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in 
patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is still underappreciated. 
The main objective of the present study was to assess the prognostic value of TR 
in incident PAH patients.
METHODS: Consecutive incident PAH patients were enrolled from 2011 to 2021. 
Patients underwent right heart catheterisation (RHC), cardiopulmonary exercise 
test (CPET), echocardiography including the degree of TR, tricuspid annular 
plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), ratio of TAPSE to systolic pulmonary artery 
pressure (sPAP), right ventricular (RV) areas and right atrial area. The primary 
end-point of survival analysis was all-cause death.
RESULTS: Compared with patients with mild TR or no TR, those with TR of moderate 
degree or more had a worse TAPSE and TAPSE/sPAP, similar RV areas at 
echocardiography, worse peak oxygen consumption at CPET, and higher right atrial 
pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance at RHC. TR of a moderate degree or 
more was the only echocardiographic parameter associated with poor survival on 
Cox regression analyses (hazard ratio 3.34, 95% CI 1.73-6.45; p<0.001). The 
assessment of TR severity was crucial to determine the prognosis of patients who 
would have been categorised as low risk based on normal values of TAPSE or 
TAPSE/sPAP values.
CONCLUSION: In treatment-naive PAH patients, TR is an important 
echocardiographic prognostic indicator. In particular, as an emerging concept, 
assessment of severity of TR is critical to stratify the prognosis of patients 
who would have been considered at low risk based on normal values of TAPSE or of 
TAPSE/sPAP.

INTRODUCTION: Pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare and 
severe disorder characterized by obstructive vascular changes that can lead to 
right heart failure. The clinical presentation and underlying causes of 
pediatric PAH differ significantly from those in adults, often involving 
congenital heart disease and developmental lung disorders, such as 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Despite advances in treatment, pediatric PAH 
remains underrecognized globally.
METHODS: This study analyzed global, regional, and national trends in pediatric 
PAH from 1990 to 2021 using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
database.
RESULTS: The findings indicate a stable prevalence rate globally, with a slight 
increase in the absolute number of cases. Significantly, reductions were 
observed in both mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) associated 
with pediatric PAH, with mortality decreasing by 57.66% and DALYs by 63.59% over 
the study period, indicating progress in mitigating the disease burden. 
Substantial regional disparities were identified, with low-income regions, 
particularly Low Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) areas, experiencing the highest 
mortality and DALY rates. In contrast, high-middle SDI regions showed the 
greatest reductions in disease burden. The highest prevalence and burden were 
observed in South Asia, the Caribbean, and parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, with 
China, India, and Haiti bearing the greatest national burdens.
DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the necessity for targeted health 
interventions, especially in low-resource settings, to improve early diagnosis, 
intervention, and treatment.

OBJECTIVE: Dextrocardia refers to the right-sided positioning of the heart 
during embryonic development and may occur in isolation or in association with 
visceral malposition or other malformations. However, few studies have 
investigated this condition. This study aimed to determine the incidence of 
cardiac and non-cardiac malformations, as well as to analyze long-term follow-up 
and survival outcomes in patients with dextrocardia.
METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of dextrocardia cases at King 
Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from April 
22, 1975, to December 31, 2016. A total of 259,246 transthoracic echocardiograms 
from that period were reviewed, and 357 patients were included in the analysis.
RESULTS: The incidence of dextrocardia was approximately 1 in 28,571 pregnancies 
(0.35 per 10,000 pregnancies). Most patients with dextrocardia were between 2 
and 18 years old (n = 252, 70.6 %). The most common type was isolated 
dextrocardia (situs solitus), followed by situs inversus totalis, and situs 
ambiguous. The most common congenital cyanotic heart diseases were double outlet 
right ventricle (n = 55, 15.5 %) and pulmonary atresia (n = 35, 9.8 %). The most 
common acyanotic congenital abnormalities were ventricular (n = 152, 42.7 %) and 
atrial (n = 121, 34.2 %) septal defects. Overall survival in the study 
population was approximately 83 %. Survival rates varied by situs type, with the 
highest rates observed in patients with situs inversus (96 %), followed by those 
with situs solitus (91 %), and situs ambiguous (55 %). Moderate to severe 
pulmonary hypertension was significantly associated with a reduction in overall 
survival. The most common non-cardiac anomalies observed were gastrointestinal 
and urogenital abnormalities.
CONCLUSION: This study describes the largest regional cohort of patients with 
dextrocardia, providing important insights into dextrocardia and outcomes of 
different intracardiac defects in our community. Our findings confirm that 
complex congenital cardiac disease is more common in patients with situs solitus 
and isomerism group. Patients in the isomerism group (12.6 %) had significantly 
higher mortality rates compared to those in the situs solitus (7.6 %) and situs 
inversus (3.7 %) groups.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease that can be caused by 
pathogenic variants, most frequently in the bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptor 
Type 2 (BMPR2) gene. We formed a ClinGen variant curation expert panel to devise 
guidelines for the clinical interpretation of BMPR2 variants identified in PAH 
patients. The general ACMG/AMP variant classification criteria were refined for 
PAH and adapted to BMPR2 following ClinGen procedures. Subsequently, these 
specifications were tested independently by three members of the curation expert 
panel on 28 representative BMPR2 variants selected from ClinVar and then 
presented and discussed in the plenum. Application of the final BMPR2 variant 
specifications resolved six of nine variants (66%) where multiple ClinVar 
classifications included a variant of uncertain significance, with all six being 
reclassified as Benign or Likely Benign. Four splice site variants underwent 
clinically consequential reclassification based on the presence or absence of 
supporting mRNA splicing data. These variant specifications provide an 
international framework and a valuable tool for BMPR2 variant classification 
that can be applied to increase confidence and consistency in BMPR2 
interpretation for diagnostic laboratories, clinical providers, and patients.

BACKGROUND: Combined immunotherapy and antiangiogenic therapy have exhibited 
synergistic antitumor effects in several cancers. The prognosis of recurrent or 
metastatic cervical cancer (r/mCC) is poor, especially for patients with prior 
multi-line treatments. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
cadonilimab(PD-1/CTLA-4 bispecific)with anti-angiogenesis adjuvant therapy 
(bevacizumab or anlotinib) in pretreated patients with r/mCC.
METHODS: Nineteen patients treated with cadonilimab plus bevacizumab or 
anlotinib with or without chemotherapy were included. Cadonilimab was 
administered at dose of 10mg/kg intravenously. Patients receiving 
anti-angiogenic therapy received either bevacizumab or anlotinib administered 
orally. The safety, objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival 
(PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed.
RESULTS: The median follow-up was 15.5 months study patients. Among all 19 
patients, 2 patients (10.5%) achieved complete response (CR), 2 patients (10.5%) 
achieved partial response (PR) and 4 patients (21.1%) achieved stable disease 
(SD), with an ORR of 21.1% and DCR of 42.1%. Moreover, the median PFS was 10.5 
months (95% CI: 6.1-14.9 months) and 1-year OS rate was 78.3%. Proteinuria 
(47.4%) and hypertension (42.2%) were the most common treatment-related adverse 
events (TRAE), with 5 (26.3%) patients experiencing Grade 3 TRAEs, while no 
treatment related deaths were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report exploring the efficacy and safety of 
treating patients concurrently with Cadonilimab plus bevacizumab or anlotinib 
with heavily pretreated r/mCC. The findings suggest that this regimen might be 
potentially efficacious and safe with relatively manageable toxicity. Further 
trials with a control arm are required to validate our findings.

BACKGROUND: Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is a cornerstone of secondary 
prevention in patients with minor ischemic stroke or high-risk transient 
ischemic attack. The effectiveness and safety of DAPT may differ between 
patients with posterior (PCI) and anterior circulation infarct (ACI).
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare short-term outcomes following DAPT between 
mild-to-moderate stroke patients with PCI versus ACI.
DESIGN: Propensity-matched analysis from a prospective real-world multicentric 
cohort study (READAPT).
METHODS: We included patients with noncardioembolic mild-to-moderate stroke 
(National Institute of Health Stroke Scale of 0-10) who initiated DAPT within 
48 h of symptom onset. Patients were categorized into ACI or PCI based on the 
infarct(s) location on brain neuroimaging. The primary effectiveness outcome was 
the 90-day risk of ischemic stroke or other vascular events. The secondary 
effectiveness outcomes were the 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 
distribution, 24-h early neurological improvement or deterioration, and 
all-cause mortality. The safety outcomes included the 90-day risk of any 
bleedings and 24-h hemorrhagic transformation.
RESULTS: We matched 281 PCI patients with 651 ACI patients. The 90-day risk of 
ischemic stroke or other vascular events was low and similar between PCI and ACI 
groups (3.1% vs 2.9%, respectively; hazard ratio 0.98, (95% confidence interval 
(CI) 0.45-2.14); p = 0.845). Patients with PCI had worse 90-day mRS ordinal 
distribution compared to those with ACI (odds ratio 1.18 (95% CI 1.01-1.39); 
p = 0.046). There were no differences in other secondary outcomes. Safety 
outcomes had low incidence and did not differ between groups (any bleedings: 
3.2% vs 2.6%; 24-h hemorrhagic transformation: 1.8% vs 1.2%). We found no 
differences in the risk of ischemic stroke or other vascular events between 
patients with PCI and ACI across subgroups defined by sex, age, presumed stroke 
etiology, stroke severity, prestroke mRS, hypertension, diabetes, acute 
reperfusion therapies, DAPT loading dose, or presence of symptomatic 
intracranial stenosis.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that effectiveness and safety outcomes after 
DAPT in patients with mild-to-moderate noncardioembolic ischemic stroke are 
consistent regardless of infarct location in the anterior or posterior 
circulation territory. However, patients with PCI may experience worse 
short-term functional outcome.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate disease self-management and its 
influencing factors among empty nesters with comorbid hypertension and type 2 
diabetes mellitus in the Chinese community.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was administered to 385 empty nesters in 
the community with comorbid hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, including 
general information about the patients, the conditions of hypertension and type 
2 diabetes mellitus, and self-management scores. The results were analysed using 
independent samples t-test, one-way ANOVA and multiple linear regression.
RESULTS: Disease self-management ability among 360 empty nesters in the 
community with comorbid hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus was low to 
moderate level. The results of the multiple linear regression analysis showed 
that age, education, healthcare payment method, and systolic blood pressure were 
common influences on self-management of the two diseases; hypertension 
classification, body mass index, and 2-hour postprandial blood glucose were 
influences on self-management of hypertension; and diabetes treatment method and 
residence mode were influences on self-management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
CONCLUSION: Primary healthcare providers need to pay close attention to the 
self-management skills of empty nesters with comorbid hypertension and type 2 
diabetes mellitus in the community, especially in terms of disease monitoring 
and dietary management. Effective self-management health education, including 
sustained and effective lifestyle interventions, should be provided as early as 
possible for those living alone, newly diagnosed, less educated, and with 
limited healthcare resources, and the addition of elements of Chinese medicine 
health management, can also be considered to play a role in integrating 
prevention and treatment.

Hypertension affects one-third of the worldwide adult population and is a major 
contributor to premature mortality in Thailand. However, hypertension is mainly 
preventable, highlighting the need for effective prevention strategies to 
mitigate this critical health concern. This scoping review aimed to identify 
existing knowledge gaps and provide a comprehensive understanding of 
hypertension prevention interventions. Keywords were identified, and an 
unrestricted search for empirical studies was conducted until December 20, 2024. 
The search strategy encompassed 11 databases. Ultimately, studies focusing on 
preventive interventions targeting the Thai population at risk of hypertension 
were included in this review. Finally, we included 41 studies: 35 in community 
settings, two in hospital clinics, and four in Buddhist temples. The total 
number of participants was 16,401, ranging from 32 to 4,786, aged between 18 and 
74. Research designs comprised 32 quasi-experimental studies, seven randomized 
controlled trials, one action research, and one research and development. 
Researchers primarily delivered interventions. The interventions focused on 
hypertension monitoring, knowledge promotion, health behavior modification, 
social support, and counseling, emphasizing preventive behaviors, nutrition 
promotion, and disease awareness. Researchers commonly took outcome measurements 
before and 12 weeks after intervention. Manuals, logbooks, and lectures with 
presentation slides were the primary platforms. Finally, knowledge, behaviors, 
and biomarkers were the most frequently assessed outcomes. This scoping review 
provided recommendations that future research should expand intervention 
strategies, emphasize biomarkers, adopt modern delivery methods like AI chatbots 
and mobile apps, and include follow-ups beyond 12 weeks to ensure lasting 
impact.
